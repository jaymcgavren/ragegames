<h2>Review</h2>

<img src="blazinglazers.jpg" align=right>

<p><b>Game Type: Overhead-View Shooter</b>
<br>Very much within the bounds of the average shooter formula. Fly
around, dodge bullets, shoot back.

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>All I need to do to covince many shooter fans to buy this game is 
mention it was developed by Compile, the group that brought us the
almighty Zanac and Space Megaforce. By and large the game lives up to
expectations, too, with a nice powerup system and decent gameplay. There
are four types of main shots, each of which can be powered up several
times. These can be used simultaneously with any of four additional 
powerups - twin options (which mimic your current weapon), full fire (which 
is a different and more powerful version of your current weapon), shields, 
and homing missiles. Many of the weapons were later seen again in Space 
Megaforce. The weapon systems aren't quite as fancy as Megaforce's but
they still leave plenty of room for experimentation. A couple of the 
weapons are a little too powerful, though. It's possible to get through 
early stages just by grabbing shields and parking yourself in a corner. 
If you don't abuse your abilities, though, the game is quite playable.

<p><b>Graphics: 60/100</b>
<br>Here's the only area the game flops in. It's not that the look is 
especially bad, and in fact the graphics are quite colorful. But the 
designs of your ship and the enemies are awkward and the animation could 
be a lot better. The not-quite-overhead-view angle doesn't quite work, 
either. And that intro! Retch! Almost decent graphically but not quite.

<p><b>Sound: 70/100</b>
<br>I'm not sure the grainy voice samples when picking up powerups were
necessary, but aside from that the sound and music are decent. Far from 
outstanding audio but it gets the job done.

<p><b>Overall: 90/100</b>
<br>If it only had the graphic appeal of the other Compile shooters 
(except for M.U.S.H.A. of course), I would like this game a lot better.
But the gameplay is fairly good, and even though it's no Space
Megaforce the weapon system is much deeper than almost any other shooter.
For that I can heartily recommend it to any shooter fan.
