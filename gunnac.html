<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: Overhead-View Shooter</b>
<br>Pretty much a typical overhead shooter. The only exception is the four 
types of bombs, which power up if you grab the same type repeatedly. Five 
weapon types which can be powered up eight times each if your wings haven't 
been damaged.

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>I was overjoyed to learn there was another shooter by Compile available 
for the NES that I hadn't even played yet. For the most part, it lives up 
to expectations. It isn't as addictive as Zanac overall, but the weapon 
systems are nearly as deep as the SNES's Space Megaforce. Too bad the 
weapon designs aren't as intriguing. Gun-Nac has the most complex bomb 
setup of any shooter to date, though, and that helps make up for it. Each of the four
"bomb" types has a distinct movement pattern, which makes some more suitable 
for certain targets than others. Each type can be powered up four times, 
but higher power levels take more bombs out of your reserve. Basically 
what all this means is that not only do you need to make sure you have 
the right gun for the current situation, you also need to watch your bomb 
type and power level, and grab appropriate powerups for each, all while 
dodging bullets. Should keep any shooter fan quite busy, especially if you 
turn on the option to have each destroyed enemy shoot one last bullet...

<p><b>Graphics: 60/100</b>
<br>The graphics are fairly detailed, but a more simplistic look usually 
works better with the NES's limited color pallette. Also, while I have 
nothing against cutesy games, mixing a few cute enemies with these dark 
colors and a host of more realistic enemies just doesn't work. I'm afraid 
the graphics bring the overall game down a bit.

<p><b>Sound: 90/100</b>
<br>The soundtrack consists of upbeat tunes with the most fierce drum 
beats the NES can muster. The sound effects are likewise the cream of 
the NES crop. One of the last NES games where I won't put on a CD while 
playing.

<p><b>Overall: 80/100</b>
<br>Those dark graphics and incoherent enemy designs really drag Gun-Nac 
down. But if you can tolerate fighting starships, bunny rabbits, and rolls 
of toilet paper threatening to kill you with cottony softness all at 
the same time, you might like this game. The deep weapon systems will 
definitely make it worth any shooter fan's while, doubly so for Compile 
fans. Think of it as a translation of Space Megaforce for the NES.
