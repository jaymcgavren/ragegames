<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Platform</b>
<img src="rygar.jpg" align=right>
<br>Based loosely on the old Atari arcade game of the same name. Your
character does all the usual platformer stuff - he runs, bounces off 
enemies, whacks them with a giant bladed yo-yo (please, that's so 
cliche), etc. Most areas are side-view but a few overhead-view 
sequences have been thrown in.

<p><b>Gameplay: 80/100</b>
<br>The gameplay is for the most part decent. The control is very good 
and the action is solid. Unfortunately most bosses are extremely cheap 
and can only be beaten by means of brute force; it's annoying to have to build up experience before you can face them. The overhead-view sequences 
are lame, too. But aside from a few poor examples of enemy design this 
game is pretty worthwhile.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>Rygar is unmatched graphically even by many later NES releases. It 
was one of the first to feature parallax scrolling. The look is very 
colorful, and all the areas have a solemn beauty. All this is 
unfortunately hampered somewhat by profuse slowdown and flicker when 
the screen gets crowded, though.

<p><b>Sound: 70/100</b>
<br>Some of the tunes are rather inspiring, but others grate on the 
nerves after a while. One song consists of <b>four</b> notes playing 
over and over and over... Overall, though, it's not too bad. The sound 
effects are decent, too.

<p><b>Overall: 80/100</b>
<br>Although Rygar has its weak points it's one of the most pleasing 
games on the NES in terms of gameplay and aesthetics. It probably 
would've achieved classic status even if it wasn't released as early 
as it was. Whenever I get into that questing mood this is usually the 
game I plug in. (Right after Zelda.)
