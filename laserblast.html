<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D side-view shooter</b>
<br>
Actually the above classification isn't very meaningful because, like many 2600
games, Laser Blast defies categorization. You control a flying saucer that
scrolls screen-by-screen over a simple landscape. Sets of 3 tanks on the
ground fire up at you, and by an ingenious but tricky to learn method of
control you return fire.

<p><b>Gameplay: 95/100</b>
<br>Half the game is learning to aim the laser. You must do so without the 
benefit of crosshairs, but once you get the feel for the control you can 
fire very accurately. As you progress your ship moves higher and higher into
the sky, and hence further from your targets. Unfortunately the tanks' aim
improves with each level. You can dodge their shots to some degree but since
the lasers don't spend any time travelling to their target it becomes a
matter of killing the tanks off before they fire a shot in higher levels.
When you've been hit it's also very satisfying taking out one last tank with
a kamikaze dive.

<p><b>Graphics: 80/100</b>
<br>Not bad by 2600 standards. Scrolling screens were rarely seen in that day.
The flying saucer with its cool spinning edge beats the heck out of those
shapeless ships from Space Invaders or Vanguard. Although it has some fancy
effects the graphics have a simplistic, clean look overall. (That's good.)

<p><b>Sound: 80/100</b>
<br>The zap of lasers, the echoing thunder of exploding tanks, the screaming
descent of a downed saucer. No music, but who wants to hear the 2600 play
music? Decent effects well suited to the game.

<p><b>Overall: 95/100</b>
<br>Although I've discovered that today I really *wouldn't* want to play some of 
the games I remember so fondly from 15 years ago, Laser Blast is one of the
few that retains its allure. Few other 2600 games give me the high I get from
Laser Blast when I'm raining destruction down on the enemy.
