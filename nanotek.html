<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 3D Chase-View Shooter</b>
<br>You've seen this before in the form of Spy Hunter or Tempest, but never 
from this perspective. Your ship clings to the outside (or inside) of an 
endless tube, and the only gravity is the pull of the tube itself. You 
rotate freely around the edges, blasting oncoming enemies with your 
standard shot or any of several limited-ammo special weapons you pick up 
along the way. Obstacles must either be jumped over or dodged around.

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>Pure action, unhindered by anything resembling realistic physics. It's 
as if Galaga was suddenly switched to a 3D perspective without adding 
inertia to the control or even much gravity beyond what was needed to 
bring you back down after a jump. This feels wierd at first in a polygon 
game, but once you're used to it the gameplay is perfect. The control is 
marvelous, and your ship always reacts instantly. It's a good thing, too...
<br>In other games, there's always a moment when you're headed strraight 
for a brick wall, and you think to yourself, "Well, this is it, I'm going 
to die." That thought will repeat itself in your head so many times while 
playing N-Tek that all you can do is assume a Zen-like calm and charge 
straight at that titanium tower (or unbeatable mid-boss, or whatever).
Miraculously, a skilled player will always pull through somehow, and it's 
an incredible feeling. At <i>no</i> point will you be bored while playing 
this game, and very few titles can say that anymore.

<p><b>Graphics: 80/100</b>
<br>N-Tek has all the neat frills that made Wipeout XL look so cool, 
although maybe they're not applied with as much finesse. The polygon popup 
horizon is quite distant but since there's nothing to obscure your view 
it's also quite obvious. These are minor gripes, though, and all things 
considered the graphics pull their weight almost as much as the gameplay.

<p><b>Sound: 80/100</b>
<br>Techno soundtracks are (almost) always a good thing, and N-Tek's isn't 
bad. Unfortunately it isn't astoundingly good, either. You won't even notice 
the music while playing; it's just sort of there. The sound effects are 
another story. The explosions have incredibly deep bass - you can <i>feel</i> 
it when the bosses go up in smoke. But I could do without the mildly 
annoying alarm that goes off when your shields are below 50% (which is 
almost always the case). Sound effects and music volume can be adjusted 
separately, thankfully.

<p><b>Overall: 80/100</b>
<br>If Tempest X3 is hardcore techno, this is a Top 40 remix. Okay, so it's 
totally devoid of depth. It's still a lot of fun, and shooter fans or indeed 
anyone looking for a pure action game absolutely must take a look.
