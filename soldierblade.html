<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D overhead-view shooter</b>
<br>
The standard overhead shooter formula, except that the options following
you around can be used up to produce a brief super-powerful burst from your 
current weapon (acts like 3 different types of bombs). 3 weapon types, 3
power levels each.

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>Pretty intense. You'll have all kinds of ships carrying all kinds of
weapons thrown at you. Some sections force you to weave from one side of
the screen to the other and back at high speed, and all of them chuck bullet
after bullet at you. Your ship's movement rate is adjustable. In addition to
the main game there is a speed mode with its own stage.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>Huge battleships and bosses, and nifty-looking weapons and
bombs. Although it doesn't look cartoony the graphics scream "this is a
drawing, not a metal warship," which doesn't appeal to me, though others
might like it. Still, it looks pretty polished, and I love the bright colors.

<p><b>Sound: 70/100</b>
<br>Not especially compelling music, and the sound effects are decent but
have no real oomph. Why the gratuitous sampled voices? Good but not great.

<p><b>Overall: 85/100</b>
<br>A highly challenging shooter that offers a lot of variety. It's fun to
play for score in speed mode, too. The bosses are incredible! Well worth 
checking out for shooter fans.
