<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Fighting</b>
<br>A pretty basic Street Fighter II clone except for a couple unusual features.
There are only four buttons used during the game, and one of these is a taunt 
button. The Jab, Strong, and Fierce buttons function as either punches or kicks 
depending on your character and your stance. You can dash forward or back by double 
clicking the joystick.

<p><b>Gameplay: 70/100</b>
<br>Must the character roster be so sorrowfully small? There are only 8 initially 
selectable fighters and one major boss (plus two more if you count the bonus bosses, 
but not much design work went into these). Of the 8 characters only about 5 are any 
good (your mileage may vary). And these 5 seem rather poorly balanced, and don't have 
quite the range of standard and special moves I'd like. The gameplay isn't awful but 
your time is better spent on Street Fighter Alpha 2.

<p><b>Graphics: 80/100</b>
<br>The backgrounds are probably the most beautiful I've seen in any fighting game. 
All of them feature several layers of parallax, and many fights take place in shallow 
water where you can see the sky and even the fighters reflected in the rippling 
surface. Some character designs and animation are passable but don't live up to 
quite the same standard, and some characters are just downright stiff-jointed and silly 
looking. Some special moves are flashy but others are just drowned out by the colorful 
backgrounds.

<p><b>Sound: 80/100</b>
<br>A fairly cool rock soundtrack, thudding sound effects, and decent voice acting. 
Not outstanding but reasonably good.

<p><b>Overall: 70/100</b>
<br>I so much want to like this game, because some effort was obviously put into both 
the Neo Geo version and this translation. Effort, but maybe not quite enough talent. 
The characters just don't have the range and balance of moves needed to make extended 
play an enjoyable experience. At least GF has one thing going for it: Roomi, the cutest 
girl in fighting game history. Rent it to see her at least.
