<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Does a racing game have to feature hovercars for me to really like it?
Apparently so, because I haven't enjoyed a racer this much since F-Zero.</p>

<p>I think a lot of the negative Wipeout reviews circulating the Net are from
those who didn't give themselves a chance to get used to the control. It
is decidedly loose, so much so that you need to begin steering left or right
well before a turn to avoid the wall. Skillful use of the airbrakes is a must
as well. A few have even said the weapons are difficult to use, but again
it's a matter of taking time to learn how to use them effectively. A rocket
fired down a straightaway can't miss, but to hit an opponent 
rounding a curve you want the homing missiles.</p>

<p>The game isn't wildly impressive graphically, but the tracks do look nice,
and popup is kept to a bare minimum. Sound is realistic to the point where
it can be used as a tool to determine where your opponents (and their
weapons) are. The music is excellent techno (stored as music tracks, so it
can be played from the CD player).</p>

<p>My only real complaint is that there are only 6 tracks (seven counting the 
hidden one). Still, the game itself is playable enough that I'm happy 
trying to beat my best times on the existing ones.</p>
