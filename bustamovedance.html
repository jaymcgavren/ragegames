<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: Pattern Repetition</b>
<br>You choose one of ten characters (plus four more hidden ones) to 
compete in a danceathon against an opponent. Tap out the sequence of 
buttons shown on the screen in time to the rhythm and your character 
will do a series of wild dance moves. You can also opt to use one of 
a limited stock of "attacks" against your opponent, which will stun 
her for a few seconds. Pull off more cool moves than your opponent 
before the song ends and you'll win the match.

<p><b>Gameplay: 80/100</b>
<br>Think of it as Parappa the Rapper meets Street Fighter. The game 
is played much the same way, by repeating the displayed key sequence. 
But this time your opponent is the computer or another player, rather 
than a simple rating meter. It's a bit easier to play, since 
only the last key in the given sequence needs to be repeated in time 
with the music. (It's pressed every fourth beat.)
<img src="g/bustamove2.jpg" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5>
<br>Like Parappa, though, BAM has a bit of a longevity problem. Although 
there are 14 different characters, there are no major differences in 
how they're played. When you've beaten the game with one character 
(which is no difficult task in the first place) you can easily do so 
again with all the others. It's great fun for a week or so, but after 
that most players will lose interest.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>Graphically this may be one of the most impressive Playstation 
games in existence. The characters are quite detailed, with very 
few individual polygons visible. The backgrounds are nice also, and 
are almost alive with activity. One stage is set in a rickety 
beach hut, which falls to pieces around you as a hurricane blows 
in. Another is on a city street, complete with swerving cars. 
I don't totally like the color schemes, but technically at least 
BAM's graphics are quite impressive. 

<p><b>Sound: 60/100</b>
<br>I revere the Japanese for their artwork and game design, but 
I never quite agreed with their taste in music, especially their 
imitations of Western rock. Admittedly this is one of the best 
collections of this type of music I've heard, but that's not 
saying much. Many of the lyrics are in English (cringe), but 
they're actually pretty good, sung/rapped either by Americans or 
very talented Japanese. The music itself largely consists of 
parodies of 70's disco, 80's pop, and even a little rap and 
reggae. I'm sad to say there's only one techno track, and that's 
of dubious quality. Maybe the American release's tracks will be 
better, but I rather doubt it.

<p><b>Overall: 80/100</b>
<br>If you're worried that a rave game created in Japan might have a 
little too much Japanese flavor for American palates, you might be 
right. For one thing, Japanese rappers simply can't say "niggah" 
without sounding silly. (Yes, they do say that during one track, 
though in a nonoffensive way.) But the game does have some real 
attitude. Their gangsta rapper character, for example, tends to bust 
out with a pair of semiautomatics - while dancing. There is of 
course lots of bizarre humor as well, like the John Travolta clone 
or the dancing mouse.
<br>Much like Parappa, I can't imagine playing this game nonstop for 
a month, but bring it out when friends are over and it's good for a 
few laughs. (And unlike Parappa, a second person can play.) It's due 
for U.S. release very soon, so it's probably not worth the extra cost 
of importing. (Unless you consider that they will inevitably screw 
up the music and lyrics in the process of Americanizing them.)
