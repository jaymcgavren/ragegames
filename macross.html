<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Virtually every shooter released for the SNES has been crap, with one very
notable exception being Space Megaforce. And while Macross comes nowhere
close to competing with that granddaddy of all shooters, it certainly holds
its own against the likes of R-Type and Darius. Too bad it was never released
here in the States...</p>

<p>Macross is based on the anime series of the same name, though I can't tell
how closely it follows the animated version (never seen it). From what I
understand the three pilots you can choose to play as are all major
characters from the show.</p>

<p>Your ship can transform into 3 different forms, each of which moves at a
different speed and has its own weapon. The weapons each pilot uses differs
with each form, for a total of 9 weapons in all, and each weapon can be
powered up 3 times. You can switch between the 3 forms at will but you have
to be careful in doing so; take a hit and the weapon you're using powers
down.</p> 

<p>Perhaps coolest of all, if you don't fire for a couple seconds a field
will form around you, and if any enemy touches this you will take
control of their ship, causing them to fly around you like an option and fire
at the other enemies. Almost all the enemy types can be captured, and each has
their own weapon and moves in a different way. You can only control one
enemy at a time, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Some other trivia... I wish the game was a stage or two longer but 7 stages
will suffice. Difficulty is selectable so you can play through the game at
least two or three times. Music isn't stellar but it doesn't grate on your 
nerves, either. Sound is average. The graphic effects are pretty good but
the artwork is nothing special.</p>

<p>If it weren't for all the variety the powerups and captured enemies provided,
I probably wouldn't think much of this game due to its unremarkable looks
and sound. But fans of the series definitely will not be disappointed, and
those who appreciate a good shooter might want to import it.</p>
