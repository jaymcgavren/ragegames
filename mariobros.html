<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Platform</b>
<br>Two players race around a screen full of enemies, leaping to knock into
the platforms above and stun the enemies overhead. Once an enemy is
stunned they must hurry to kick it over the edge or it will recover (and
it'll be really, really pissed off when it does). Clear a quota of enemies
to proceed to the next round. 

<p><b>Gameplay: 80/100</b>
<br>Donkey Kong meets Joust, or at least that's what Nintendo hoped to create
back in the 80's. They were moderately successful in capturing Joust's 
cooperative/competitive two player aspects. Two players can either help each 
other get as far in the game as possible, or use any number of dirty tricks 
to kill off the other character. Beware if your friend decides to do the 
latter. Players can stun each other by knocking into the platforms from below 
or stomping on each others' heads. While that in itself isn't deadly you can 
easily be knocked into a critter's path. Stunned critters can be revived by 
knocking the platforms, and if you're trying to kick one off the screen when 
your friend/opponent revives him... well, you get the idea. Unfortunately 
the more competitive matches can be very brutal and very, very brief, leaving 
one player to cool their heels while the other finishes their game. The two 
player mode definitely has its imperfections. But skilled players may well 
find it quite enjoyable.
<br>Even with one player MB isn't half bad. Beware, though; your characters 
have a fair amount of inertia, and if you don't like games where you skid 
about the screen you won't like this. Most folks are already used to this 
sort of control from Super Mario Bros., though. Unlike SMB, there's no huge 
world to explore. There's just you and a screen full of snapping turtles. 
But means there's nothing but pure arcade action, and that's the way it 
should be.

<p><b>Graphics: 80/100</b>
<br>Platforms, pipes, solid black background. That's all there is to the game 
screen. Not much graphic detail, but less is sometimes more. This is the look 
that the NES is ideally suited for. The colors and character graphics are 
appealing, and there are one or two bits of excellent animation. My only 
complaint in the graphic department is the constant, subtle flicker on all 
the enemy sprites.

<p><b>Sound: 90/100</b>
<br>No music, just an excellent set of cute sound effects. But again, less is 
sometimes more.

<p><b>Overall: 80/100</b>
<br>My favorite type of game is one that takes a simple idea and 
implements it really, really well. This is one of those games. I can't 
guarantee you'll enjoy it in the long term with two players or even 
with one, but it's a fun jaunt for a while at least.
