<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Fighting</b>
<br>This is the series that defines 2D fighting. Need I say more?

<p><b>Gameplay: 95/100</b>
<br>I must first make it clear that my ratings will treat Second Impact 
as its own distinct game, for which I respect it, rather than as an upgrade 
to SF3, which I do not. 
<br>Truth is that not that much has changed. There are only three new playable 
characters, only one of which Capcom had to do any new artwork for, and that 
one character design is horribly lame. Aside from that there are a few new 
backgrounds and pallette swaps of all the others, a few new special moves 
scattered among the characters (Yang now has a few moves different from Yun), 
and tweaks and timing changes to many existing moves and combos.
<br>I won't say that it's not an improvement, though. Experienced 
SF3 players will have to relearn even their old favorite characters to work new 
moves into their routine or compensate for a change in the timing of a combo. And 
of course there are new characters like the upgraded Akuma, Gill (in the form of 
his slightly weaker lookalike Urien), and the Andore-esque Hugo to learn how to 
use and/or abuse. And of course the same old addictive SF3 gameplay is there, just 
tweaked and (maybe?) improved.
<br>OK, so it's not much of an upgrade. But it is an excellent game. It's based on 
the greatest fighting game ever, so how could it not be?

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>Gameplay wasn't the only area that was tweaked. Menus, onscreen displays, 
the stages themselves... everything has a darker, cooler look now. Gone are the 
cute bystanders like the wannabe ninjas by Ibuki's dojo, or the silly tribesmen 
at Elena's arena. The effect is very cool. The same insanely high level of 
animation quality is still there of course. A further improvement to an already 
graphically beautiful game.

<p><b>Sound: 90/100</b>
<br>Even music and sound have been tweaked to a degree, and the snippets of new 
tunes I've heard do sound quite cool. Like most people, though, I can only play 
this in a noisy arcade for now, so I can't go into audio extensively. Maybe 
someday they'll reintroduce headphone jacks like on the Neo-Geo systems.

<p><b>Overall: 95/100</b>
<br>I don't know at this point which will game history will remember, SF3 or 
this new revision. Frankly either would do. But there's no doubt that fighting 
game fans will look back fondly on one or the other.
<br>When playing SI you'll find yourself thinking "this is how it should have 
been in the first place..." more than once - in regard to the moves, graphics, 
you name it. It's not changed sufficiently for me to look on it as a whole new 
game, to be sure. But hey, you should be making at least weekly trips to the 
arcade to play SF3 even without a new revision.
