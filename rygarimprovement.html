<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Rygar is one of my fondest memories from the early days of 
the NES. Every once in a while I still get the urge to pull out 
the cartridge and give it a spin. I can't get enough of the 
beautiful scenery, and that bizzarre but utterly kickass 
diskarmer the hero packs.

<p>It was probably due to my fondness for the game that I was 
willing to sit down at my hex editor a couple months ago and 
begin the tedious process of trying to locate the map data.
A couple days later all I had managed to do was screw up some 
tiles in the Rolsa Valley. I was unimpressed. I jotted down 
the addresses of those tiles in the Hacker's Database and let 
it drop for a month.

<p>But it kept nagging at the back of my mind, and eventually
I started poking around again. A day later I had located the 
Sueru Mountains and had the format completely figured out. 
Another week and I had my first three custom levels completed.
But it wasn't much fun plugging away in a hex editor, and I 
posted a plea for help in making a level editor on the front 
page of Rage Games.

<p>A few days later I got an e-mail from Chris Hickman, the 
founder of Archaic Ruins. It turned out he had some C 
experience, and wanted to help. I gave him the data I'd found 
and a patch with my current edits. 72 hours after that he had
a basic editor going. 

<p>After that it was smooth sailing - only 3 complete 
overhauls to the editor on Chris' part and a week of almost 
nonstop work on my part grabbing and chopping up screenshots. 
We are pleased to present to you our level editor, Rygar 
Improvement, and even more pleased to be done with the 
project. Phew!

<h2>Designers' Tips</h2>

<p>If you've ever used a level editor, you know that games 
are programmed to be run only with their original levels and may 
not work as well with anything else. Players can still use and 
enjoy your new maps, though, if you follow some basic rules:

<ul>
<li>Doorways should remain accessible. Even if it leads to a 
hermit who merely gives you a minor hint, it's frustrating 
for the players if they can see the door but can't reach it.
<li>Ropes can't be moved. They are a separate feature from 
the rest of landscape and will hang in the same place even if 
you move the tree that they hang from (which looks silly).
<li>Rope ends must be flush with the ground. If the ground is 
above or below the end of a rope (top or bottom), players can 
climb it but won't be able to dismount. Also, only the types 
of ground that allow players to pass through from below (tree
branches, rounded stone ledges) should be placed at the top 
of a rope.
<li>The data for some screens is reused in several places.
Make sure you know every location a screen is used in and 
plan accordingly before you edit it.
<li>Keep solid walls at the edges of a level if possible. If 
you leave an opening at either end, players will be able to 
jump off the edge of the screen. The screen will scroll, but 
you have no way of knowing where it will scroll to.
<li>Some enemies can only appear on certain types of ground. 
If the ground is even a square too high or too low, no 
enemies will appear. Strolling through an entire level with 
nothing to fight is extremely boring for the player.
</ul>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="files/rimp-100.zip">Rygar Improvement</a>, the level editor.
<li>Rygar ROM, U.S. V1.0 <b>NOTE:</b> All ROM requests will be ignored.
<li>An emulator such as <a href="nestc043.zip">Nesticle</a>, for 
bugtesting.
<li><a href="snestl12.zip">SNESTOOL</a> to create an IPS patch (since 
distributing even an edited ROM would violate copyright law).
