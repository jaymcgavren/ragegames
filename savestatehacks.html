<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>Emulators use save states to let the user store their 
progress in a game. When you load a save state file into 
an emulator, you can return to your game at the very 
instant you saved the system state, almost as if you had 
paused the game.

<p>Emulators achieve this by saving all the essential data 
that the system is processing at the time into a file. When 
the file is loaded up again, the virtual game system resumes 
processing the data as if it had never halted.

<p>Since the file the emulator saves contains all the 
essential data about your character, you can make changes to 
it and have those changes reflected in the game when you 
return to it. Your number of remaining lives, power ups you 
have available, or (in RPGs) attack power and other stats 
are all stored in the file, and all can be changed. It's only 
a matter of finding which parts of the file contain the data.

<p>Here's what you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hex editor and basic understanding of its use
<li>An emulator
<li>A game ROM
</ul>

<h2>Hacking Extra Lives</h2>

<p>For our first example we'll be using Super Mario Bros. for 
our game, Nesticle for the emulator, and Hex Workshop for the 
editor.

<p>The basic idea is to get two or more state files that are 
nearly identical except for one change - the variable you 
want to hack. We'll try something simple for now - getting 
extra lives in SMB.

<table>
<tr align=left>
<td rowspan=2>
<ul>
<li>Start up Nesticle and open the SMB ROM.
<li>Press 0 to select state slot 0.
<li>Begin a new game, and immediately press F5 to save 
the game's state (while the black screen with your 
remaining lives is still showing).
<li>Press 1 to select state slot 1. (But don't save yet!)
<li>Now run over to the first Goomba and let him kill you, 
so that your lives remaining go down to two.
<li>While the black screen is showing, press F5 to save the 
game state into slot 1.
</ul>

</table>

<p>Two files, mario1.sta and mario1.st1 (depending on the file 
name of your ROM), should now be saved to your disk. Now:

<ul>
<li>Run Hex Workshop and open mario1.sta and mario1.st1.
<li>Under the Tools menu, select Compare. Choose the Hex 
radio button so that you're comparing hex values and leave 
all the other options alone.
<li>Click OK. The hex editor will search both files and 
find the first byte that is different between the two files. 
Jot the offset (location) down for later reference.
<li>Press F6 to find the next byte that has changed, and 
jot it down also. There shouldn't be more than a few
dozen that are different. If there are, you may have 
allowed too much to change from one state file to the 
other. Did you save both states while the black screen was 
still showing? Try repeating the process from the start.
</ul>

<p align=center><img src="savestatehacks1.jpg"></p>

<p>Once you know all the bytes that have changed, click on 
mario1.sta's window in the hex editor. Find the first byte 
that has changed and edit it to match the byte at the same 
offset in mario1.st1. Save the changes to the file.

<p>Now go back into Nesticle and reload the SMB ROM. Press 
0 to select slot 0 and press F7 to load the edited 
mario1.sta file. 

<p>Even if you've found the right byte to change, the number 
of lives remaining won't reflect this just yet. Kill 
yourself off again so that the black screen is updated, 
then see what your remaining number of lives says. If 
the number is still 2 (which it's supposed to be), you 
haven't found the right byte yet.

<p>Go back and find the next byte that has changed, change it 
to match the same byte in mario1.st1. Save your edits, 
load mario1.sta into the emulator, kill yourself off again, 
and so on.

<p>When you suddenly find that you have only 1 life left 
instead of 2, stop! You've found the address you need to 
edit. (For this example, it was offset 275A.)

<img src="savestatehacks4.jpg" align=right>

<p>Now just to be sure you have the right address, edit the 
same byte to a higher number than before, like 9 or 
so. Save your work, load it into the emulator, and kill 
yourself off. The number of lives remaining should read 9.

<p>Congratulations! You've completed your first save state 
hack. Now you can open any Super Mario Bros. .sta file, 
edit the byte at offset 275A to any value you'd like, 
and reload it for extra lives.

<h2>Hacking RPG Inventories</h2>

<p>Next we'll try something a little tougher - changing your 
inventory in Phantasy Star 2. For this experiment you'll 
need a Phantasy Star 2 ROM, Genecyst, and of course Hex 
Workshop.

<img src="savestatehacks5.jpg" align=right>

<ul>
<li>Run Genecyst and load your PS2 ROM. Begin a new game. 
<li>At your first opportunity, go to the item shop. Buy a 
Monomate and answer Yes when asked if you need anything else.
<li>Once you're back to the shop's main items menu, save 
the game state to slot 0.
<li>Buy another Monomate and again say Yes, you do need 
something else.
<li>Back at the shop's main items menu, save the game to 
slot 1.
</ul>

<p>The files pstar2.gs0 and pstar2.gs1 should now be saved to 
your disk. (Again, the filenames depend on your ROM's 
filename.) Open both in Hex Workshop.

<p>This time we're not going to bother writing down all the 
hex offsets. Now that you have some clue what you're doing, 
we'll try to save a little time by making a logical guess 
as to what may have changed.

<p>RPG items are usually stored in a game save as single bytes. 
A potion might have the value 15, a sword the value B7. If 
there is no item in a particular spot in your inventory, 
it's usually represented by a 00.

<p>So in pstar2.gs0, you have a slot in your inventory that is 
empty, but in pstar2.gs1, that same slot is taken up by a 
Monomate. You can reasonably guess that in pstar.gs0 the byte 
that represents that inventory slot is 00, but in pstar2.gs1, 
that byte is some value higher than 00.

<p>Run a comparison between pstar2.gs0 and pstar2.gs1 in Hex 
Workshop. Write down only the offsets that have changed 
from 00 in pstar2.gs0 to a value higher than 00 in pstar2.gs1.
There will probably only be one or two.</p>


<table width=100%>
<td><p>Now change these offsets in pstar2.gs0 to match their twin 
in pstar2.gs1, one at a time. You should test your changes 
each time by loading pstar2.gs0 into Genecyst, leaving the 
shop, and checking your items menu. If you suddenly have a 
second Monomate, you've found the offset you need to change.
(For me it was offset E4A4. If you were working with a 
different inventory slot it might be different for you, but 
it should still be a nearby offset.)</p></td>
<td><img src="savestatehacks6.jpg" align=right></td>
</table>

<table width=100%>
<td><p>Now comes the fun part. You can set the byte at the offset 
you've discovered to any value you want, and you'll get a 
different item for each. Try setting it to 12, load it and 
test it. Your Monomate will turn into a Dimate. If you 
keep changing, loading, and testing values, you'll find 
the following:</p></td>
<td><img src="savestatehacks7.jpg" align=right></td>
</table>

<br clear=all>

<center>
<table width=300>
<tr align=left><td>11</td><td>Monomate</td>
<td>17</td><td>Headgear</td>
<tr align=left><td>12</td><td>Dimate</td>
<td>18</td><td>Ribbon</td>
<tr align=left><td>13</td><td>Trimate</td>
<td>19</td><td>FiberGear</td>
<tr align=left><td>14</td><td>Antidote</td>
<td>1A</td><td>Sil Ribbon</td>
<tr align=left><td>15</td><td>Star Mist</td>
<td>1B</td><td>Sil Crown</td>
<tr align=left><td>16</td><td>Moon Dew</td>
<td>1C</td><td>TitaniGear</td>
</table>
</center>

<p>If you're familiar with Phantasy Star 2, you've probably 
noticed that the items seem to be getting more and more 
valuable as the hex value increases. If you keep raising 
the value, you could eventually wind up with the best 
weapons and armor in the game. In some games (like Final 
Fantasy II), it's possible to use this technique to find 
items that were removed from the U.S. version and aren't 
accessible by normal means. Once you've hacked an item 
into the save state, it can be equipped and traded like 
any other item, too.

<p>Next experiment... Go back into the shop and buy all the 
Monomates you and Nei can carry. Save the game state to 
slot 0 and open pstar2.gs0 in Hex Workshop. (If you 
already had it open, you need to close the file and 
open it again or the changes won't appear. Go to hex 
offset E4A4. Notice anything different? 

<p>The bytes surrounding offset E4A4 are all filled with the 
value 11. You can also see a second string of 11's 
starting at E4E4. If you'll recall from earlier, 11 is 
the value for a Monomate. These are all the Monomates you 
just bought and saved. The second string of 11's is Nei's 
inventory.

<p>Go to all the bytes that just changed to 11, and change 
them to 1C. (The value for a TitaniGear.) Save the file, 
and load it in Genecyst. Your inventory should now be 
filled with Titanigears. You can change any of these 
bytes you just discovered to any value you want, and get 
any item you want.

<p>These are just a couple examples of your newfound abilities. 
With a little creativity, you can do anything. Apply this 
technique to Metroid, and you can use it to get special 
items right at the start of the game. Try it on Final 
Fantasy, and you can set any character's maximum HP to any 
value you want. It'll work on save states for SNES 
or in fact any system whose emulator supports them.

<p>So what're you waiting for? Go test your skills on your 
favorite game. If you find any useful offsets, be sure to
