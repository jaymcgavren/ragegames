<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter</b>
<br>You control a submarine trying to rescue divers. Gather up as 
many as you can while shooting down sharks and enemy subs and
get the people back up to the surface. Stationary screen, and of course 
only one shot type, no powerups.
<br>

<p><b>Gameplay: 95/100</b>
<br>I played a quick game of Raiden II before I pulled out the 2600 to
write this review, and believe it or not I had more fun with Seaquest.
(Gotta set Raiden's difficulty higher...) Though simplistic by modern
standards Seaquest is highly complex compared to most 2600 games.
Not only do you have people to rescue and enemies to dodge, you
have to return to the surface periodically to refill on oxygen, all while
watching out for enemy subs patrolling the surface. It's a lot to juggle.
<br>Perhaps the coolest feature of Seaquest is the constant
introduction of new challenges as you progress. It's not like they
introduce whole new types of enemies (this is 2600, man), but they do
start emerging in new patterns and at new speeds, more than I can
say for most 2600 games.
<br>

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>Keeping the limitations of the system in mind, Seaquest looks
pretty darn good. The resolution on the player, divers, and enemies is
great. The wave effect at the top of the screen is nifty, too.
<br>

<p><b>Sound: 50/100</b>
<br>It doesn't bother me much but the sound effect when you fire is pretty
loud, and needless to say you'll be hearing a lot of it. The alarm when
you're running low on oxygen is decidedly annoying. Aside from that
there's not a lot to hear; the enemies never make even a whisper.
<br>

<p><b>Overall: 95/100</b>
<br>No, you can't play as Darwin, but Seaquest is still one of the most
playable games in existence for the 2600 or any system. Watch your
local garage sales and flea markets and you can probably pick it up for
the price of a pack of gum, but it's worth more than a lot of those $60
games out today.
