<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Platform</b>
<br>Gunstar Heroes without the guns. Marina, our android heroine, can use her 
superhuman strength to lift enemies off of their feet, grab bullets out of the 
air, rip flowers out of the ground - er - anyway... Whatever she picks up she 
can toss at other enemies. She can also dash along the ground and in any direction 
while airborne.

<p><b>Gameplay: 80/100</b>
<br>Overall pretty decent, but not as addictive as I'd been hoping (considering that 
developer Treasure also did Gunstar Heroes). I wanted pure baddie-blasting action, 
but in most stages I got tests of my precision jumping skills. Yawn. You'll have to 
attempt the trickier levels a gazillion times, and apparently the designers expected this 
because even if you fall in a pit you start back a short ways with only a bit off your HP 
bar. After repeating the same stage ten times in one life I got positively bored. Still, 
the control is fairly good (it uses only the digital pad), Marina's moves are cool, and 
those sections that do have some action are a lot of fun.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>The Genesis is hardly a graphics powerhouse, but you saw what Gunstar did for it. Now 
imagine what Treasure might do with the N64 at their disposal. The bosses are absolutely 
<i>amazing</i>, beautifully animated, and often quite large. I don't know what prompted 
them to antialias 2D graphics, but the effect sure is cool. My only complaint is that almost
every object in the main levels is constructed out of building blocks straight out of 
Van Gogh's worst nightmares. Too wierd. Despite being rendered the characters don't look too 
bad, which is surprising since they're all done in the anime style.

<p><b>Sound: 50/100</b>
<br>The dubbing on the voice samples isn't too bad, but each sample is used way too much and 
in places it probably shouldn't be. (Does she ever stop saying "Stop!"?) That gripe aside 
the audio is decent, with good-quality sound effects and okay music.

<p><b>Overall: 80/100</b>
<br>Don't even think about buying it; you'll have it beat within the first couple days. MM is 
<i>way</i> too short. The need to seek out a hidden crystal in each level adds some replay 
value, but not much. You absolutely, positively gotta rent it, though, if only for the 
graphics. You'll start gibbering when you see that first boss.
