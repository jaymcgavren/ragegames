<p>It is widely known that not all of the Molblins living in the 
forests of Hyrule were pleased with the archmage Ganon's rise 
to power. Ganon's opressive rule and harsh conscription policies
alienated many Molblin clans. It is even rumored that some offered 
supplies and monetary aid to the elven warrior Link, the hero 
that eventually slew Ganon.
<p>But one young Molblin warrior even went so far as to take 
matters into his own hands. When his clan allowed Ganon to 
take many of his brethren as slaves he rebelled against his 
elders and set out to destroy the evil wizard and free his 
kindred. This is his story.

This edit simply replaces Link's character graphics in The 
Legend of Zelda with those of a Molblin (with a couple tweaks 
added for animations the Molblin simply didn't have.) Link's 
sword is also replaced with the Molblin's spear. Aside from that 
the game remains unchanged. This hack was originally released 
as a Nesticle .STA file, which unfortunately made it impossible 
for those with other emulators to use it. Many thanks to Weiss 
for converting it to an IPS patch!
