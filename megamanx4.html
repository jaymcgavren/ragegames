<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Platform</b>
<br>Run, jump, shoot. 8 bosses, each one you kill gives you a new weapon. If you're not familiar 
with the Mega Man series after over 20 games you need to nip off and shoot yourself in the head 
pronto.

<p><b>Gameplay: 80/100</b>
<br>Finally, <i>finally</i> you can play as Zero for real! In X3 you only got to use him for a 
tiny part of each stage, and switching characters all the time simply wasn't worth the effort. 
Now he has a whole separate storyline, his own anime cinemas, even his own attacks from 
each of the 8 bosses. Since any of these special moves can be executed at any time with a simple 
button combination, Zero might even be the character of choice (almost reminds me of Shinobi III, 
although the special controls need a bit more work). Unfortunately you can no longer switch 
between Zero and X at will, but that hardly ruins the game.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>The graphic style is almost exactly the same as Mega Man 8, meaning you can expect beautiful 
animation (God, Zero's hair is cool) and backgrounds, but the character art could use a bit of 
work. The characters could stand to be a bit larger and a lot more detailed. But this probably 
won't bother players too much. The FMV anime cinemas are cool but like in MM8 they're practically 
all still shots.

<p><b>Sound: 10/100</b>
<br>Aaaaggghh! Is Capcom <i>trying</i> to kill me? This is the worst dub I have <i>ever</i> 
heard, videogame or otherwise. You'll be appalled at the voices even if you're not a pro-sub 
otaku like me. The in-game samples are only mildly annoying, but the cinemas are completely ruined 
by the awful voice acting (and the story could have actually been decent, too). It actually 
diminished my enjoyment of the game. I don't think I've ever recommended importing the Japanese 
version of a game after its American release, but if you're a true Mega Man fan you might actually 
want to consider getting Rockman X4 instead.

<p><b>Overall: 80/100</b>
<br>I don't think even the Japanese version would have gotten a 90 rating from me, though. The 
boss designs just aren't as polished as in MM8, making some of the fights tedious, and the 
overall game is way too easy. (I beat it with Zero the first night and got all the special items, 
too). Since this is basically just a rehash of Mega Man 8 I can't recommend getting both unless 
you're a die-hard Mega Man fan.
