<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: Overhead-view shooter</b>
<br>It's been done. Look down from above as your ship blasts evertyhing
that moves and collects powerups.

<p><b>Gameplay: 95/100</b>
<br>Decidedly unoriginal, but I love a game that takes a proven concept and
does it exceptionally well. It's great that the game has a whopping 12
stages (though four of these are awfully similar to each other), that it
has flawless control, and that the action is wildly intense due to the
incredible number of enemies and bullets being flung at you. But my favorite
part about Megaforce is that it has a more complex weapon system than any
shooter before or since. An arsenal of 8 different weapon types is pretty
impressive, but 8 weapons each with 6 different power levels each with 2-6
different firing modes (selectable at will) is overwhelming! This is the only
shooter I know of deep enough to inspire a discussion on Usenet of
techniques for using each weapon.

<p><b>Graphics: 95/100</b>
<br>Colorful, functional (bullets and enemies are highly visible), and just
plain cool. Megaforce has some of the best graphic effects ever seen on the
SNES, and the most ever in one game. One stage consists of a vast space
station that scales and rotates in from the background to attack you. We're
not talking some little sprite here; the *entire stage* is coming after you!
Other stages have entire galaxies undulating sickeningly in the background,
bosses rippling in from hyperspace, and much more.

<p><b>Sound: 95/100</b>
<br>Fwooom! Now *this* is bass. This game has the most powerful explosion
sounds I've ever heard on a SNES. The music is some rather gruuvi but
slow-paced techno. One of the few SNES games for which I'll bother unhooking
the Playstation from the stereo.

<p><b>Overall: 95/100</b>
<br>Grapples with Raiden II for consideration as my all-time favorite
shooter. Raiden won out due to its awesome graphics and playability but only
by a slim margin. Long after I've mastered Raiden, though, I will still be
toying with all the weapons in Space Megaforce and trying to beat that
damnable "Wild" difficulty level.
