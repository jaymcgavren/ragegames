<p>After the first Metroid game, the space-fighter chick
gets a little bored. Shes sitting around her
space-station or whatever and says to anther
space-fighter chick friend, "You know, since I beat up
that Mother Brain on that one planet, I've been
looking for a new job. There just aren't enough things
out there for space-suit wearing women who have
guns attached to their hands. I need to find a new
planet, with new mazes, and new items that I collect
to help me along my journey. But there just aren't
enough places like that left! This universe is becoming
more civilized, my friend, and there just isnt a place
for us old-fashioned, gun-toting space avengers." 

<p>And the other space-fighter chick is like, "Well, you
can always just go and blow a bunch of aliens up for
fun. Say, is there a Starbuck's around here?" 

<p>"Um, yeah, I think theres one on Tralfamadore 3850-B
or something. Wait, you're right! Who says I need a
reason to go and blow up aliens?!?! Heck, I'll just land
my ship on the nearest moon and make dog-meat out
of every alien I see! Just because I can!" 

<p>"Sounds like a just cause. I'm going to get a
Frapacinno. Bye." So our brave space-chick flys her
ship over to a new planet called Ballidia
Eleven-Thirty-Eight and prepares for a new adventure.
She goes down into the catacombs, whips out her
wave-beam and blasts a whole cavern of
space-urchins into thick n chunky picante sauce. The
woman looks around contentedly and smiles inside her
helmet as she steps on a nest of bat eggs before her.
Did she get them all? No! A swarm of cave-bats,
instincts telling them to attack the baby-killer, swarm
are upon her! In an instant, she ducks down into a ball
and evades them, placing a trail of flashing bombs,
each pregnant with radioactive death. The explosives
ignite, scattering the first few bats anatomy like
soggy confetti. The bats behind them were exposed
to the radiation and fell to the ground, pulsating a
while before their skin melted off of their skeletons like
a carmel apple. Then, a metroid sneaks up behind her,
but her incredible relfelxes alert her to its presense.
She whips around and fires off a steady stream of
freeze-beam, solidifying the creature in the air. The
woman arms her missile launcher and blows open the
once fiersome and majestic creature like a frozen
strawberry rendering the walls a nice hue of reddish
brown. "Since I still have all my weapons from the last
game, none of these aliens present any threat to me.
Where's the challenge? I am going back up to my ship
and storing the weapons there and then I'll come back
down and start from scratch."
