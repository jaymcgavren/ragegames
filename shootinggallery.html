<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: Light Gun Shooting</b>
<img src="shootinggallery.jpg" align=right>
<br>The premise is simple enough - aim your light gun at the screen and 
shoot ducks, balloons, anything that moves. You have a certain number of 
targets of varying types to hit per round, and as long as you nail the 
minimum number you'll progress to the next stage. The Sega Light Phaser 
is required to play.

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>Basically Shooting Gallery does everything Duck Hunt does, only 
better. There are five different types of targets versus, um, one for 
Duck Hunt (well, two if you count clay shooting). Each of those target 
types has lots of movement patterns, versus one for Duck Hunt.
There are several different backdrops, versus one for Duck Hunt. You 
get the idea. SG is very fast paced, and unless you're really good a 
game will rarely last more than five minutes. Even if you are good you 
may never see every trick the game has to throw at you. Once you beat 
the first eight stages you'll have seen all the target types, but then 
they start following new and even faster movement patterns. Best of all, 
the game tracks where your shot went, so if your aim is wild you'll  
blast a dozen holes in the backdrop (and in your ego).

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>The graphics are rather simplistic but very colorful and the style 
is appealing. The animation on the flying ducks and exploding targets is 
splendid.

<p><b>Sound: 60/100</b>
<br>The warbling music is neither annoying nor enjoyable; it's just sort 
of there. Ditto with the sound effects (not that there are that many 
anyway). The voice sample that announces a perfect score is extremely 
grainy and was probably unnecessary.

<p><b>Overall: 90/100</b>
<br>Forget Virtua Cop, Shooting Gallery is Sega's greatest light gun 
shooter. In fact, it's one of the best gun games of all time. It 
represents my favorite kind of game - simplistic but with 
lots of polish and nice effects. Its speed and perfect skill curve 
make it really addictive, too. If you can't find a Master System, get a 
Power Base Convertor for your Genesis and simply plug the Light Phaser 
into the controller port (it'll work perfectly). It's a purchase no 
light gun enthusiast will regret.
