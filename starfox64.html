<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: Chase-View Shooter</b>
<br>The worthy sequel to the SNES blockbuster. Steer your tiny starship 
between skyscrapers, asteroids, and canyon walls while blasting 
enemy ships. Some sequences place you in a tank which can jet sideways 
or even hover. Supports up to four players simultaneously with 
split-screen.

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>The control is a bit looser than in the SNES version, so shooting 
accurately will be a bit difficult at first even for veterans of the first
game. In time, though, it becomes easy enough, and the lock-on laser (a la 
Panzer Dragoon) helps out. Even though analog control provides variable 
turn speeds, you're still allowed to bank (R and Z buttons) for an 
extra-quick dodge. You'll need it, too, because there will be buildings 
falling on you, wayward space debris tumbling into your path, and much 
more. Although some sequences let you turn freely, most of the time you 
must move within a particular corridor, as in the first. New stunts like 
the loop-de-loop will let you take on the occasional enemy which 
approaches from behind. All these new tricks take time to master, even 
for those who've played the first, but once you get the hang of it the game 
is a blast. Even the hovertank sequences are fun.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>Unfortunately there is the occasional bit of slowdown, but otherwise 
the graphics are stellar. No really fancy effects, just appealing colors, 
huge bosses that fill the screen, and lots of smoke and explosions.

<p><b>Sound: 50/100</b>
<br>The semi-classical soundtrack is okay but nowhere near as inspired as 
the first. The sound effects are decent. There are tons of voice samples, 
and every radio communication is speech, not text. Too bad some of the 
voice acting is nearly as awful as Resident Evil's.

<p><b>Overall: 90/100</b>
<br>A highly playable and replayable game, just like the first, but with 
up-to-date graphics. Rent an N64 and this game if you don't own one; it 
may well convince you to purchase both.
