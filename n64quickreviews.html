<dd>Game Type: First-Person Maze
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Graphically I'm not at all impressed. You'd think the N64 could move a little bit 
beyond Doom for the Playstation. The mission mode is your average corridor shooter; in 
other words not that bad. But that four-player mode... Wow. Cool weapons like grenades, targetable 
guns with sniper sights, and remote detonated mines give you more ways to kill your friends 
than even real life. Once everyone gets the hang of the controls (which does take awhile) you will 
see some absolutely diabolical strategies employed. Get three friends hooked as soon as you can.

<dd>Game Type: 3D Racing
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Though there are a couple neat effects I'm just not that impressed with the graphics. Racing 
against the computer is a real yawner, too. But this is yet another N64 game that really shines 
in four-player mode. Maybe not enough to justify purchase since there's not that much variety, but 
this makes a fantastic rental.

<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The U.S. release of Treasure's Yuke Yuke Trouble Makers. <i>Incredible</i> special effects but 
the graphics don't appeal that much, and the gameplay is merely good rather than great. (C'mon, 
this is Treasure we're talking about here!) Also way too easy. A must-rent but don't buy.

<dt>PilotWings 64
<dd>Game Type: Flight Sim
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The insane level of realism in the flight physics is lost on me, so as far as I'm concerned 
this is a hopelessly dry game hidden under a couple cute gimmicks. If you're into flight sims 
I'm sure you'll like it better than I did.

<dd>Game Type: 3D Racing
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Where are the awesome soundtrack and alluring challenge of the original? Even the expert mode 
is just too easy. The new vehicles aren't too bad but I'd rather stay in the Arwing. At least the 
four player mode makes up for all this. It's sheer barrel-rolling, loop-de-looping madness, and a 
hell of a lot of fun (though there should be more arenas).
<dt><a href="supermario64.html">Super Mario 64</a>
<dd>Game Type: 3D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Like any other Mario game it's fun to explore the first time through and from then on it 
gathers dust on my shelf. You'll spend many, many hours finding every nook and cranny 
of the 15 huge (and beautiful) courses. And though it's difficult to navigate like any 3D game, 
Mario makes it simpler than any other. But "addictive" is the very last word I would use to 
describe it. A must-see for anyone, but adrenaline freaks needn't bother with purchasing it.

<dt><a href="turok.html">Turok - The Dinosaur Hunter</a>
<dd>Game Type: First-Person Maze
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Features some neat special effects and some nice scenery. The enemies move very realistically, 
too (except for the fact that they spend more time running around than shooting at you). But it 
lacks the awesome enemy AI and cool gameplay of Doom, and overall it's just another pretty face.

<dt>WaveRace 64
<dd>Game Type: 3D Racing
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Again, the realistic physics are lost on me, leaving merely average gameplay and graphics. 
Rent first, maybe you'll like it better than I did.
