<p align=center><b>The Story So Far...</b></p>
<p>For a wizard of Ganon's power, death is but a temporary 
setback. His defeat at the hands of the legendary hero Link 
only redoubled his rage. Ganon has returned to life more 
powerful than ever, and has recaptured Princess Zelda and 
the Triforce of Power. 
<p>Using the Triforce's energy he has twisted the land of Hyrule 
into a treacherous maze. He holds Zelda captive in his lair, 
knowing Link will surely try to rescue her.
<p>If Hyrule is to be restored, the Triforce of Power and the 
Triforce of Wisdom must be reclaimed. Link must face this 
strange new world to save the Princess and return peace to  
the land.
