<h1>What The Spook Grooves On</h1>

<p>This page is dedicated to some things that make this mortal
coil a bit more bearable, for me at least. Keep your eyes
open, I've buried a lot of links in here!</p>

<dl>
<dt>The Apple Macintosh
<dd>My favorite OS, designed to actually aid you in getting work
done, as opposed to Windows, which is designed to help sell
how-to books. Note I do not say favorite computer; all the
Macs in my price range, including the one I own, are pretty
underpowered. If Apple would write a version of their OS for
the PC we could all have the intuitive Mac interface *and*
the power of a PC, and Bill Gates would be living in the
gutter in no time.

<dt>POV-Ray
<dd>A fantastic *freeware* rendering program for Mac, PC, and
even Amiga. Unfortunately you have to learn an object
description language instead of just sitting down and drawing
landscapes, but one you have that out of the way you can
create spectacular scenes. The versatility and power of this
program never ceases to amaze me. In fact, I groove on
rendered graphics in general. Reboot is an insult to my
intelligence but I watch it for the awesome effects.

<dt>Pepsi
<dd>Well, actually, in the immortal words of Binkley of Bloom
County fame, it tastes "like malted battery acid". Thanx to
careful brainwashing on the part of the Pepsi-Cola
Corporation's Marketing department, however, I drink it to
increase my penis size, bungee-jumping skill, and overall
sexual appeal. Thanx to careful formulation on the part of
the Pepsi-Cola Corporation's Research and Development
department, I also drink it to satisfy my rather nasty
caffeine addiction. Still, nothing's better for an energy
burst when, say, you want to spend all night composing Web
pages about nothing important. Hmmm... video games,
computers, and late-night cola binges... Am I living up to a
stereotype or what?

<dt>Enigma
<dd>One of my favorite techno/ambient/whatever artists. Like most
synthesizer composers he probably has no talent with any kind
of musical instrument whatsoever, but I couldn't care less
because the music he produces *sounds good* (to me). My
friends dismiss this argument, along with all the techno
groups I listen to most. Oh well.

<dt>Watership Down
<dd>Whoah! I actually liked something others regard as a classic!
This Richard Adams novel recounts the tale of a group of
adventurers (who just happen to be rabbits) forced to flee
their home. Their goal is to find a dwelling where they won't
be killed by dogs, cats, hawks, storms, other rabbits, or
careless motorists. Though the heroes are hardly standard
fare this book will be devoured by anyone who's run out of
J.R.R. Tolkien books to read.

<dt>Green
<dd>My favorite color. I never dealt very well with red or
yellow, which are too hyperactive for me. Blue, however, is a
close runner up. My favorite natural occurence of green would
have to be in trees during the spring, as evidenced by my
staring at them for long periods and by the posters of them
on my wall (unfortunately any actual plants placed in my room
do not remain green for long). Green even sneaks into my
wardrobe sometimes: I have a pair of green jeans which I
wear with some regularity. I am often viewed by my friends
as being fashion-impaired as a result.

<dt>Disney
<dd>Creators of the greatest animated features of all time,
including Aladdin, my favorite movie of all time. One of the
few companies where quality takes priority over production
costs. I take pride in the fact that this company is
American. I love anime, but Disney allows me to say that
animated features are one thing we do better than the
Japanese.

<dt>Nakoruru
<dd>Now in fairness to the Japanese, I have to give credit to
them for Nakoruru. She appears in the Samurai Shodown series,
the third installment of which is my favorite video game of
all time, and in the anime that bears the same name. She is
very much the norm for an anime girl, huge dewy eyes, long
silky hair, and virtually no nose or mouth. I find something
about her in particular endearing, though. Perhaps the fact
that she fights for all the cliche values the good guys fight
for: truth, justice, and environmental responsibility.
Perhaps it's the the incredible skill of the SNK artists in
capturing her beauty. But probably it's just that wicked
blade she carries.

<dt>Bagels
<dd>I'd like to thank the inventor of the bagel, although they're
probably dead. The bagel has saved me from mornings of
agonizing hunger countless times, since I can grab a couple
on the way out the door even when I don't have time for a
bowl of cereal. They taste great toasted, but I've been known
to eat them plain. I'd also like to thank Bruegger's Bagel
Bakery, for getting the crust just crunchy enough, having
just enough butter on the outside, and for usually serving
them to me hot from the oven.

<dt>The X-Files
<dd>This show deserves every fanatical viewer it has. The
gimmicky spawn of resentment of the U.S. Government and a
surge in TV shows on the paranormal, it grew into the
phenomenon it is today simply because it is a superb show,
from writing to lighting. After viewing the episode with the
mites that attacked in the dark I slept with the lights on
for a week.
