<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 3D racing</b>
<br>Realtime rendered polygon racecars on a polygon track. Not overly
obsessed with realism but your cars can't fire missiles or anything like
that.

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>Basically if you've played the first you've played this. The controls
are extremely tight, which is great unless you're looking for a racer where
the cars handle realistically (not that I am). I don't think I've fishtailed
once yet. Can't say how it is with an analog controller because I don't own
one, for now. Pretty playable nonetheless. The newly added rearview mirror
lets you block opponents coming from behind. There is still only one big
track, with extensions added onto it for the different levels. The levels
differ more from each other than they did in the first, though.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>Not bad, but I had been hoping for an improvement over the first Ridge
Racer, and I don't see one. I suppose the rearview mirror is to blame. The
stretch along the beach on the Novice level is beautiful!

<p><b>Sound: 50/100</b>
<br>No improvement. The techno music is the right idea, but now Namco needs
to find an artist with some actual talent. The copilot's voice is even more
annoying now, and though you can adjust his volume down it means losing the
other sound effects as well. "Ha, ha, you're too slow!" Grrrr....

<p><b>Overall: 90/100</b>
<br>My hopes for a vast improvement over the original were disappointed.
The game is solid, and I would love it if it had a couple more tracks.
Still, RRR blows away all the other "realistic" driving games on the market.
Those who own the first should only consider this if they're sick of seeing
the same old track, though.
