<dt>1942
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Playable? Sorta. But disgusting to look at and listen to. One of the earliest
NES games, and it shows in the graphics.
<dt>3D Worldrunner
<dd>Game Type: 3D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Not quite a Space Harrier clone, unlike the cover implies. Your character
runs along, able to slow down but not stop, and must dodge oncoming enemies
and leap over pits. Includes 3D glasses mode.
<dt>Abadox
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View/Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Alternates between side and overhead views in different stages. Passable
gameplay, lame powerup system. Dodge bodily fluids that the different creatures
spew at you. Gross.
<dt>Adventures of Bayou Billy
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A pretty standard beat-em-up with nice graphics and gameplay. Later stages
include shooting (with crosshairs or a light gun) and a frustrating driving
game. Rather tough.
<dt>Adventures of Dino Riki
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Although you control a caveman instead of a ship this is a true shooter
as far as gameplay is concerned. Cutesy graphics, passable gameplay.
<dt>Adventure Island
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A cute, fast paced Super Mario Bros. clone. Appealing, cartoony graphics
and lots of hidden secrets.
<dt>Adventure Island II
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Serves up more of the same action from the first but you can now ride any
of several dinosaurs, all with different powers. Rivals SMB3.
<dt>Adventures of Lolo
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A cute game with simplistic control but complex puzzles. Potentially
frustrating.
<dt>After Burner
<dd>Game Type: 2D Chase-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Some genres the NES wasn't made to handle, and the 3D shooter is one of
them. The result of this halfhearted attempt at a port is the loss not only of graphic
quality but also of any playability the original had.
<dt>Anticipation
<dd>Game Type: Board Game
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>A Win, Lose, or Draw clone. Nice graphics and fun the first few times 
but after you've seen every puzzle the thrill is gone.
<dt>Arkanoid
<dd>Game Type: Ball and Paddle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The best breakout game in existence, very addictive. Bounce a ball 
around the screen to break bricks and catch powerups to give your paddle 
various abilities like firing lasers. Nice graphics. Works okay with the
control pad but it's best if you can find one of the analog dial controllers
that was originally included (if it still works).
<dt>Astyanax
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Impressive graphically and fairly playable but not addictive.
<dt>Athena
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are appealing but the character animation is awful and the
gameplay is weak. Avoid.
<a name="b">
<dt>Bad Dudes
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A semi-playable but graphically lame port of the arcade Shinobi clone.
<dt>Batman
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>One of the few NES movie licenses to do credit to its namesake.
Challenging and highly playable. The animation is awesome, and the graphics
recreate the dark, gothic look of the movie perfectly.
<dt>Batman Returns
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Yecch. BR is by a totally different publisher, and it sucks. This Double
Dragon-style brawler has lame graphics and boring gameplay.
<dt>Battle Chess
<dd>Game Type: Strategy
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>As good a port as the NES can be expected to handle. Battle Chess is standard
chess, but when one piece captures another there's a hilarious animation of
them fighting each other for the square. The NES version unfortunately cuts 
away to show the fight instead of it happening right on the board.
<dt>Battle of Olympus
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Nice graphics and decent gameplay but later stages are confusing and 
frustrating. Highly recommended to anyone who couldn't get enough of Zelda II
but I can't think of anyone matching that description.
<dt>Battletoads
<dd>Game Type: Depth-Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Still one of the best games graphically ever seen on the NES, and the
gameplay ain't too shabby either. Unfortunately every few stages the player
is subjected to an impossibly difficult sub-game, such as dodging pillars on
a hoverbike.
<dt>Battletoads and Double Dragon
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>One of the most ridiculous character crossovers in history, but a great
game nonetheless. Places less emphasis on the ridiculously hard sub-games
than the original Battletoads. So impressive graphically that the publisher
saw fit to port it to the SNES as-is (which admittedly was a mistake but hey,
what do you want from a NES?)
<dt>Bee-52
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>If you can forgive the pun long enough to try the game out, you might get
into it. The graphics are nice and the pollen-gathering concept is novel.
But note I said "might" get into it; it's frustratingly hard to get the hang
of the game.
<dt>Bignose Freaks Out
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>As close as the NES gets to Sonic the Hedgehog. You play a nasally blessed
caveman riding the first skateboard through lengthy stages designed for speed.
Unfortunately it's all too easy to collide with enemies that pop out of nowhere.
<dt>Bionic Commando
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Why, WHY hasn't this game appeared on any system since the NES? Instead of
jumping your character swings across gaps on a grappling hook. Stellar gameplay
but the graphics are showing their age a bit.
<dt>Blades of Steel
<dd>Game Type: Hockey
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Action-oriented hockey game complete with fighting. Solid play, a great
two player game.
<dt>Blaster Master
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Excellent graphics and decent gameplay. Lengthy and challenging.
<dt>Bomberman
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Without a vs. mode this game ain't nuthin. Plant a bomb next to a wall,
retreat, let it explode, advance. Repeat this often enough and you'll go
insane. Get the SNES version so you can try to kill others.
<dt>A Boy and His Blob
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Despite the obscene title the game is all right. Feed your giant pet amoeba
jellybeans in different flavors and he'll change into a variety of tools to 
get you past various obstacles strewn around the level. Sometimes frustrating,
but never boring.
<dt>Bubble Bobble
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A decent port, well worth getting if you liked the arcade. I didn't, and
furthermore I fail to understand why anyone else did. Disgustingly cute, graphically
lame, and definitely not the gameplay marvel everyone says.
<dt>Bump N' Jump
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Racing
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A semi-cute Spy Hunter. Knock other cars off the road and jump over
washed-out bridges. A bit primitive graphically but the gameplay makes up
for it.
<dt>BurgerTime
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Does the Board of Health know about this? You're a cook who must trample
on gigantic lettuce, meat patties, etc. to get them to fall together into a completed
hamburger. You're being chased about the screen by a bad egg (literally), an angry
sausage, and other food that doesn't agree with you. Basically it's Pac-Man,
except that you can stun the enemies with pepper and crush them with falling burgers.
A good translation of a great arcade game.
<a name="c">
<dt>Captain Skyhawk
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are great but the game is unbelievably frustrating! Making
it through the first stage shouldn't be this much of a challenge. Poor control
to boot.
<dt>Castlevania
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A bit short, only 6 levels, but the later bosses are so tough you probably
won't beat it too quickly. Great gameplay and marvelous graphics.
<dt>Castlevania II - Simon's Quest
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Generally the same idea as the first but mixes in some unneeded RPG
elements like experience points and talking to villagers. Some of the puzzle
solutions make no sense at all.
<dt>Castlevania III
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Reverts back to the original's strictly-action policy (a good thing).
Play as four different characters with diverse abilities. The most graphically
impressive of the NES CV games.
<dt>Chiller
<dd>Game Type: Light Gun Shooting
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>A Zapper game with the quality you expect from an unauthorized third 
party - abysmal. The graphics are awful and it's nigh impossible to hit 
anything.
<dt>City Connection
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Pac-Man - sorta. You drive a jumping car over sections of ground, painting
them as you go. Once you've covered the ground and the various floating platforms,
you go to the next stage. CC doesn't have the addictive gameplay needed for
a game this simple. Pretty backgrounds, though.
<dt>Cobra Triangle
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A member of that bizarre category of games that isn't all that addictive
but still cool as hell to play. Excellent control, extreme challenge, and amazing
animation. Try it at least.
<dt>Commando
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>Highly repetitive with questionable gameplay and aging graphics. Not a
classic, just old.
<dt>Conan O'Brian
<dd>Game Type: Talk Show Host
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>In an earlier time slot and with better writers O'Brian could give Lenno
and Letterman a run for their money. Has a flair for good-natured humor and
a natural rapport with his guests. And what other talk show has Pimp Bot?
<dt>Conquest of the Crystal Palace
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A jump n' slash game with a somewhat cute and decidedly Japanese look.
Fairly playable.
<dt>Contra
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>A game way ahead of its time. Run and gun your way through hordes of aliens,
alone or in two player simultaneous play. Lots of different weapons available,
and the action is very solid.
<dt>Contra Force
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A game that tries to do too much. Pick any of four characters, all equally
lame. The game moves much slower and isn't nearly as enjoyable.
<dt>Crystalis
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Excels far beyond Zelda in graphics but not in gameplay. Complete the
usual checklist of quests to save the kingdom. It's been done but it's still
worth a look.
<a name="d">
<dt>Darkwing Duck
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The game feels a lot like Mega Man (same publisher) but adds a few neat
moves like shielding yourself with your cape. Stellar gameplay and great
graphics, well worth a look.
<dt>Deadly Towers
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A long, confusing, and potentially frustrating adventure. The graphics
have a strange allure, though. A love it or hate it game.
<dt>Deathbots
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 10/100</b>
<dd>Unauthorized third party game. 'Nuff said.
<dt>Defender II
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Though certainly not perfect, it's a decent translation of the arcade
classic. I should mention the lack of a thrust button, though, since Defender
aficionados always bitch about any version that doesn't have one.
<dt>Dick Tracy
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>The action is lame and the game is long and boring. Avoid.
<dt>Dig Dug II
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Arcade
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The perspective is slightly different but the action's the same. Chip
away at fault lines to break away parts of the island and any enemies on them.
Won't necessarily appeal to fans of the original but it most likely will.
<dt>Dr. Mario
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A lame Tetris clone. Line up colored pills with viruses to eliminate them.
The graphics are pretty, the control is good, and the all-around presentation
is perfect. Too bad the basic concept is so boring.
<dt>Donkey Kong
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Not quite a perfect translation of the arcade but better than any seen to
date. The control is good, the graphics are appealing, and the gameplay is,
well, it's just like the arcade (I wasn't crazy about it).
<dt>Donkey Kong 3
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>This I can get into. Appealing graphics and audio, great gameplay and control.
Very addictive.
<dt>Double Dragon
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawling
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Loses some of the amazing graphics of the arcade beat 'em up but the
gameplay is intact. The only DD game with a two player one on one versus mode,
but also the only one not to allow two players in the main game. Short but sweet.
<dt>Double Dragon II
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawling
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Offers some graphic enhancements over the original and allows two players
simultaneously in the main game, with or without the ability to accidentally 
(yeah, right) hit each other.
<dt>Double Dragon III
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawling
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Play as either of the Lee twins and pick up some additional characters
along the way. Kinda drags on after a while.
<dt>Double Dribble
<dd>Game Type: Basketball
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Before there was NBA Jam, there was Double Dribble. A basketball game 
with no simulation elements to drag gameplay down.
<dt>Dragon Warrior
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>One warrior versus one enemy at a time. Decidedly primitive but DW spawned
a lengthy and successful series (later DW games were more advanced) and defined
many of the conventions console RPGs follow to this day. Try it at least.
<dt>Dragon Spirit
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Lame graphics and weapons. Even if you liked the arcade you should try
before you buy.
<dt>Duck Hunt
<dd>Game Type: Light Gun Shooting
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>A simplistic but highly addictive game for use with the Zapper. Your choice
of two games - shooting down ducks or clay pigeons. Too bad you can't shoot
the *&%$ smartass hunting dog like in the arcade.
<dt>Duck Tales
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Mario meets Mega Man. Play as old miser Scrooge McDuck in a quest for the
only worthwhile goal on earth - to get filthy stinking rich. Highly playable,
graphically appealing.
<dt>Dudes With Attitude
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Loosely based on a computer game where you control the ball and have to
break bricks without colliding with the hazards strewn about the screen.
Ugly graphics, lame gameplay. Avoid.
<a name="e">
<dt>Eliminator Boat Duel
<dd>Game Type: Overhead View Racing
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are decent but the control could be better and the 
<a name="f">
<dt>F-15 City War
<dd>Game Type: 3D Chase-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 5/100</b>
<dd>Really shows off the (nonexistent) 3D graphics abilities of the NES.
An unauthorized game that might, just might, have taken an hour to code.
<dt>Fantasy Zone
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Wild, colorful graphics but the play leaves a bit to be desired. Purchasing
upgrades for your plane in a shop is intriguing.
<dt>Felix the Cat
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>The simplistic style of the graphics suits the NES's abilities well. 
The scrolling doesn't let you see what you're doing half the time, though,
and even the best attacks don't cover enough range to defend you. You have
to move so carefully that the game gets tedious fast. Might be OK for kids. 
<dt>Final Fantasy
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Cower before the master. Final Fantasy offers battle depth which only
the most recent Dragon Warrior games can compete with, and graphics that other
NES RPGs can't hold a candle to.
<dt>Flying Dragon - The Secret Scroll
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Mixes a martial arts side scroller with a one on one fighter. Has potential
for great gameplay but the control needs work.
<dt>Fester's Quest
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Decent graphics but the flicker is pretty bad and the action could be
better. The passable overhead sequences are broken up by confusing 3D maze 
areas.
<dt>Fist of the North Star
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>Decent graphics but extremely weak gameplay. I can't believe Nintendo
let Taxan leave in the exploding heads!
<dt><a href="flipull.html">Flipull</a>
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A solid puzzle game but the rules are complex and the play isn't as 
fast as I might like. Very challenging. If you don't mind having to think 
before each move this game is a definite winner.
<a name="g">
<dt>Galaga
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The NES could've handled a better conversion of such a simplistic game,
but the playability is intact. Addictive as hell, a must for anyone into
classic games.
<dt>Galaxy 5000
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Racing
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>One stage looks just like another, and the framerate is awful, but the
ships are smoothly animated, the gameplay is good, and the control is 
awesome. (How'd they get a digital joypad to seem like an analog?) Unique and
very playable; find a copy if you can.
<dt>Ghostbusters II
<dd>Game Type: 2D Racing
<dd>Rating: 10/100</b>
<dd>Eeeek! This game is scarier than any ghost. This is the first time I've ever 
meant it when I say the creators should be shot. The graphics are horrid, the
gameplay is hideous, and the audio is hellish. Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, 
avoid...
<dt>Ghosts n' Goblins
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are hideous but at least the gameplay is passable. Play as a
knight that's usually in shining armor. Several different weapons are available.
<dt>G.I. Joe
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The gameplay is decent but not wildly addictive. The graphics are spectacular.
<dt>Gilligan's Island
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Not worth the considerable effort necessary to find a copy. Face a series
of puzzles and get whalloped by every enemy you encounter.
<dt>Godzilla
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Play as Godzilla or Mothra, represented onscreen by possibly the largest
character sprites ever seen on the NES. Graphically impressive but the gameplay
lacks. Highly repetitive.
<dt>Golgo 13
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform/Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A wide variety of games rolled into one. Beat up spies in a side scroller,
shoot it out in a 3D maze, dodge enemy planes in a helicopter, scuba dive
through a winding coral reef. Although none of these subgames is exceptionally 
well done, overall G13 is lengthy, challenging, graphically impressive,
and probably the only NES game where the hero gets laid - twice.
<dt>Goonies II
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform 
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Very playable, but the action is broken up by bizarre 3D maze/puzzle
sequences. The chances of beating this without a hint book are slim to none.
<dt>Gradius
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Features a complex weapon system and nice graphics. Not my favorite but
worth a try, especially since it's widely regarded as a classic.
<dt>Guardian Legend
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter/Adventure
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>What might have been a cool shooter is watered down by lame Zelda-style
searches through a dungeon. Tries to do two things and does neither well.
<dt><a href="gunnac.html">Gun-Nac</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter 
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Marvelously complex weapon and bomb systems and great control. The 
strange semi-cute style and bland colors may throw some people off. Nice
art and music though.
<dt>Gyromite
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Player one races around defusing bombs before they explode, player two
(or ROB, or player one if she can juggle two control pads) raises and
lowers columns strewn about the playfield to boost the player to higher
platforms, crush enemies, and possibly crush the player by accident.
Includes an extra mode where the player must use only the columns to guide
a sleepwalker to safety. Graphically simplistic but unique and enjoyable. 
<dt>Gyruss
<dd>Game Type: 3D Chase-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Vaguely comparable to Tempest. Rotate a ship around a cluster of enemies,
blasting them as they charge at you. Two control schemes are available. Unfortunately
the graphic quality of the arcade has been lost, but it's still playable.
<a name="h">
<dt>Hogan's Alley
<dd>Game Type: Light Gun Shooting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Is that a gun or a newspaper? When you have a split second to decide it
can be hard to tell. This dilemma makes Hogan's Alley much more interesting,
as you must avoid shooting innocent bystanders but hit the bad guys quickly.
Simplistic graphics but very playable, and the bonus practice game is nice.
<dt>Hudson Hawk
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A potentially frustrating game with a heavy emphasis on puzzles. At least

<dt>Jackal

from that it's just a standard platformer.
<dt>Karate Champ
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>It's no Street Fighter. This lame fighter pits two lookalike black belts

no gameplay, no graphics, no sale.

<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Aaack! A bizarre concept (you play a fire eater escaped from his circus),
even stranger graphics, and the gameplay is lame. Those who remember it 
fondly played it back when there was nothing else to play.
<dt>Kid Icarus
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

<dd>The graphics are simplistic but the gameplay is passable. Not one of
Nintendo's best efforts, though.
<dt>Kid Niki
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>I should probably hate this game for its lame animation and weird artwork,
but the graphics are fairly appealing and the gameplay is good. You won't be
hooked on the first try but give it a chance.
<dt>Kirby's Adventure
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>One of the NES's best. Lengthy, colorful, cute, and has lots of weapons
and subgames. A bit on the easy side and the gameplay isn't all that addictive
but there's plenty to explore and do.
<dt>Klax
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Might be the best puzzle game on the NES, though Pipe Dream puts up a
fight for the title. Regardless Klax is an excellent game. Addictive and 
insanely fast paced. The graphics are awesome, the sound effects are great,
and the music is fantastic. Don't pass up a copy if you manage to find one.
<dt>Knight Rider

<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>From the programmers of the awesome NES version of Klax. The gameplay
seems simple enough; you move tiles into vertical, horizontal, or diagonal
groups with a cursor. But you'll break a sweat when the pace picks up and 
you start running out of space to put things in. It's an unauthorized third
party cart from American Video Entertainment; good luck finding a copy.
<dt><a href="kungfu.html">Kung Fu</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Many people's mouths may drop at this high rating, but Kung Fu is one of
the first examples I cite whenever I argue that gameplay is infinitely more
important than graphics. The graphics are as lame as they get but the game
itself is fast, the control is beautiful, and the play is addictive.
<dt>Kung Fu Heroes
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Platform

<dt>Legendary Wings
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View/Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A decent weapons system and good gameplay. Too bad the overhead-view
stages are broken up by those awful side-view sequences. Repetitive, too.
<dt>Lemmings
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Although there's some slowdown with 50 lemmings running around onscreen,
I still can't believe they pulled a NES version off at all. The graphics are
awesome, and the game is funny in a sadistic sort of way. Frustrating if you
can't handle strategy games but should appeal to a wider audience than most.
<dt>Life Force
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View/Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>All the enjoyment of Gradius but this adds a two player simultaneous mode.
One of the best shooters on the NES.
<dt>Little Mermaid
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Actually more a platformer than a shooter, but that's the way it controls.
Great graphics and gameplay make this well worth a look. Tell your friends
it's your little sister's if you must.
<dt>Little Nemo - The Dream Master
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Awesome graphics, decent gameplay. Encounter animal friends along the way

to the point of being frustrating, though.
<dt>Lode Runner
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>One of those games that's extremely enjoyable if you have the combination
of reflexes and intellect necessary to survive, frustrating as hell if you don't.
Allows you to create your own stages, though you can't save your work. The
graphics are simplistic, the gameplay complex. Worth a look for masochists.
<dt>Loopz
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>I would gloat at this point about being one of the few people on Earth
to own a copy if I didn't have to acknowledge that Tetris is a better
game. Still, if you love Pipe Dream, you might well enjoy this, and it has
its own allure. Seek it out as a collector's item if nothing else. (My copy
is NOT for sale. For under 50 bucks.)
<dt>Low-G-Man
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Bright graphics and a fair amount of variety, but the gameplay isn't quite
on the same level. Capture enemy robots and take control of them.
<dt>Lunar Pool
<dd>Game Type: Pool
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>My favorite pool game on this or any platform. Throws realism to the wind.
The balls float instead of rolling, the cue is just a cursor, and there are
more than a dozen different tables and many more ways of racking up. All the
strategy of pool but with a lot more variety.

<dt>Mafat Conspiracy
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The sequel to Golgo 13 is now strictly a sidescroller. The graphic quality
has been improved and the gameplay has been tweaked. Lacks some of the appeal
of the original but still worth a play.
<dt>Maniac Mansion
<dd>Game Type: Mystery
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>You control several kids as they wander around a spooky mansion. Search 
for items and solve puzzles to find a way out. Don't bet on solving it without
a hint book.
<dt>Marble Madness
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Racing
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are absolutely incredible! Race marbles down surreal courses. 
Fall off the edge as often as you want, just don't let the timer run out.
Supports two players simultaneously. I love this game dearly, and not just 
because of my affection for marble mazes. I just wish it weren't so short - 
six courses, each only a few screens long.
<dt>Mario Bros.
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 85/100</b>
<dd>Almost every game featuring Mario has been good but this is the only one
I would describe as addictive. A great two player simultaneous game. The 
intentionally slippery control may scare off some novices but stick with it
and it'll grow on you.
<dt>Maxi 15
<dd>Game Type: Multi-Game Cart
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>A collection of 15 games in one cart, a showcase for some of American
Video Entertainment's best (ahem) titles. The high rating is for Krazy 
Kreatures (see review on this page), which is the only decent game this 
cart contains. Also included are Dudes with Attitude, Deathbots, Chiller,
and Pyramid among others. Your only shot at finding one is at a video rental
store that's selling off its stock of older games.
<dt>Mega Man
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 95/100</b>
<dd>A collector may charge you twenty bucks for this but it's worth many 
times that. The Mega Man series is famous for its stellar gameplay, and 
this is the best of that series. The graphics are spartan but beautifully
designed, the enemies and bosses are perfectly engineered, and the game is
challenging but never cheap. Awesome control, lots of weapons, total platformer
perfection.
<dt>Mega Man 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>No changes were made to the control or character graphics, but a comparison
to MM1 shows the importance of careful enemy design. Sure, the enemies are
still well done, but nowhere near as fun to fight as Sniper Joe, Cut Man, or
Bomb Man. Still highly playable, but the series never regained the original's spark.
<dt>Mega Man 3
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The addition of Mega Man's slide maneuver is decidedly welcome, and brings
some life back that was lost in MM2. The longest Mega Man game yet with 16
stages. The graphics are more complex but not as appealing as in the prior games.
<dt>Mega Man 4
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Here the series goes into a bit of a slump. There are some cheap hits,
and the game begins to drag a bit after you beat the coolest bosses. Mega Man's
main gun can now be charged up.
<dt>Mega Man 5
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>No major additions, and if you've played all the other games up to this
point even a great series like this can get tiresome.
<dt>Mega Man 6
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are among the most colorful and eye pleasing ever seen on 
the NES and the enemy design comes nearer its former glory. Fans of the 
series who've purchased every game may balk at a sixth, but try it even if 
you're a Mega Man fan.
<dt>Menace Beach
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

<dd>Lame gameplay and lamer graphics.
<dt>Mendel Palace
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Original, at least. Pull the rug out from under various enemies running 
around the screen. Simplistic graphics and fair playability.
<dt>Metal Storm
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>I applaud new game concepts but switching freely between walking on the
ceiling and floor doesn't quite work. The graphics are nice, though.
<dt>Metroid
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>I may be crucified for this, but Metroid is not the greatest game ever
to grace the Earth. Sure, it's all right, with lots of turf to cover and
decent graphics, but the jumps are too floaty and the gameplay just isn't
that addictive. Great for those who value exploration over adrenaline.
<dt>Mickey Mousecapade
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The graphics and animation leave much to be desired. Nowhere near the 
quality of Capcom's later Disney licenses, but the gameplay is decent.
<dt>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out
<dd>Game Type: 3D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The graphics make good screenshots but one boxing ring looks just like
another. What the game lacks in graphic variety it easily makes up in gameplay.
You're rooted to one spot, but this puts you right in the path of your
opponent's every attack, forcing you to react and find the right time to
counterpunch. Definitely not a realistic boxing sim, but one hell of an action game.
<dt>Millipede
<dd>Game Type: 2D Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are awful but all of the high-pressure gameplay of the
arcade has been retained. Stick with it for a few games and you'll be hooked.
<dt>Milon's Secret Castle
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>I fail to see how the publisher could think forcing players to find
impossibly well-hidden doors to advance would be fun. Not much to look at,
either.
<dt>Ms. Pac-Man
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The sound could be better but this game is perfect in every other aspect.
Not quite an exact translation from the arcade but the NES version has brand-new
mazes, the optional ability to speed up with the A button, and awesome new
two player simultaneous cooperative and competitive modes where you can play
as Pac-Man. Highly addictive!
<dt>Mutant Virus
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 10/100</b>
<dd>Ever seen the computer simulation Life, where interdependent "cells"
either grow and multiply or die off according to how they were arranged?

all you did was shoot at Life cells.

<dt>Ninja Gaiden
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The action is solid, and the graphics are stellar (in most stages,

in between levels. The later stages can be frustratingly tough, unfortunately.
<dt>Ninja Gaiden II
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>

help you take out enemies.
<dt>Ninja Kid
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

<dt>Pac-Man
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The control is good and it's every bit as addictive as the arcade, but
the graphics have been shrunk to fit onto a TV, the audio is poor (they ruined
the wak-a wak-a sound), and Ms. Pac-Man completely blows it out of the water.
<dt>Panic Restaurant
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>

<dt>Paperboy
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Race your bike down the street, chucking newspapers at people's porches.
Hit a burglar and make the headlines, hit a window and lose a subscriber.
There are many more obstacles, too. Funny and original, and the graphics are 
nice, but the gameplay isn't the best.
<dt><a href="pipedream.html">Pipe Dream</a>
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>As addictive as Tetris, and it's not even directly derived from it. Use
a cursor to place pieces of pipe on a grid. Keep them linked together so the
fluid inside, called "flooz" (no comment), doesn't spill. Gain bonus points
for looping the pipes over and under each other. A must for any puzzle fan.
<dt>Pinball

<dt>Pyramid
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>

eighths. If it sounds too complicated to work well, it is. Still very unique, 
and others might not be as frustrated as I was.
<a name="q">
<dt>Q*Bert
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Not quite a perfect translation of the bizarre arcade game but the gameplay
is intact. Your character hops around a field of cubes, changing them different
colors as he goes. Enemies will chase you around the field, some of them undoing
your work as they go. Fast paced, graphically appealing, and addictive.
<dt>Qix
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>I fetched a handsome price when I auctioned my copy off months ago, but
I still regret it, especially since I doubt I can find a replacement. I've
played a variety of clones on PC and other consoles, but they can't match
the control and graphic appeal of the NES version. Highly addictive. Find 
a copy if you can, so you can sell it to me.
<a name="r">
<dt>Rad Racer
<dd>Game Type: 3D Racing
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>One of the earliest 3D racing games the NES has to offer, but it's never

<dt>Rampart
<dd>Game Type: Strategy
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Build a fort by fitting pieces of wall together as quickly as you can,

<dt>R.C. Pro-Am
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Racing
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Doesn't offer much graphic variety but the animation on the cars is unbelievable

the race up a bit, too. Oh, for a two player option...
<dt>Rescue Rangers
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Based on the ultra-cool Disney series featuring Chip and Dale. You must

too often. Playable with nice graphics.
<dt>Road Runner
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>

though.
<dt>Robo Warrior

<dt>Rocket Ranger
<dd>Game Type: 3D Chase-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>Well, the story quality is great. Too bad I can't say the same for anything

some opposition the action is still slow as hell.
<dt>Rockin' Kats
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The boxing glove gun you use works just as well for catching onto ledges

it's hampered by sluggish, flickery animation.
<dt>Rollergames
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawling
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A high-speed mix of a platformer and a brawler. Dash along city streets and 
arena tracks, jumping pits and punching your opponents. The racing sections 
are a lot of fun but are broken up by the half-baked Double Dragon-style fights. 
A good game overall, though, well worth trying and perhaps worth buying.
<dt>Rush 'n' Attack
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>

<dd>Repetitive and frustrating, with primitive graphics and only passable
gameplay.
<dt>Shadowgate
<dd>Game Type: Mystery
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A text and graphics based mystery game. Unfortunately there's no way
you'll figure out most of the puzzles without help, and once you have a

spending hours on each puzzle.
<dt>Shatterhand

<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The character graphics could be better but the simplistic, well-drawn

though, it gets really difficult really early, and there's not much replay value.
<dt>Skate or Die
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Not too remarkable graphically but the gameplay, once you're used to the

<dt>Ski or Die
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A mix of different events, like Skate, but the variety here is even 
greater. The sub-games include snowball fights with crosshairs, 3D snowboarding

among others. Great stuff.
<dt>Smash TV

<dt>Solstice
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Action

<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Simplistic but appealing graphics and decent play but the powerups are 
weak and it's way too repetitive. I won't say to avoid it but I doubt others
will enjoy it.
<dt>Spy Hunter
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Graphics don't get more simplistic than this, but gameplay doesn't get
much better, either. Drive a spy car with all the usual enhancements (machine
guns, oil slicks, etc.) at high speed and try to stay on the road while you
sideswipe other cars off. License to kill or no, don't shoot the civilians!
<dt>Star Soldier
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>A sooo lame shooter with a pathetic weapon system and awful graphics.
<dt>Star Tropics II - Zoda's Revenge
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Decent graphics and gameplay, may well appeal to Zelda fans.
<dt>Star Wars
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Very impressive graphics and cool sub-games. A bit frustrating but the
gameplay is decent. Good luck finding a copy.
<dt>Stinger
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View/Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>The only Twinbee game to make it to the States. The graphics are lame
and the gameplay could be better.
<dt>Strider
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Not much to look at but the gameplay is good. The Genesis version is an
entirely different game.
<dt>Sword Master
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Nice graphics, solid gameplay. Not quite in the same class as Ninja
Gaiden but it's close.
<dt>Super C
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>I personally didn't like the overhead-view scenes as well as the pseudo-3D
stages in the first Contra, but the side-view sequences make up the larger
part of this game and they're every bit as well-done. Tough but rewarding.
<dt>Super Dodgeball
<dd>Game Type: Sports
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A nice blend of action and strategy. A pseudo-sport where the goal is
to knock the opposing team out with a medicine ball. May appeal even to those
who hate sports games. Cute graphics.
<dt>Super Glove Ball
<dd>Game Type: 3D Ball and Paddle
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>A 3D breakout game. Unsightly graphics but the gameplay is fairly enjoyable.
Never played it with the Power Glove, don't want to.
<dt>Super Mario Bros.
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Simplistic but appealing graphics, decent gameplay, and a lot of turf
to explore. If you have somehow managed to avoid playing this game,
borrow a copy from a friend (I don't care if they live in a monastery, they 
have a copy in a closet somewhere) and play it until you beat it. It's part
of any gamer's basic education.
<dt>Super Mario Bros. 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>It wasn't originally a Mario game but it works just as well with Mario's
face on it. Beautiful graphics, original gameplay, and your choice of four
characters to play as. Not addictive but still enjoyable.
<dt>Super Mario Bros. 3
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 95/100</b>
<dd>The best Super Mario game (and that does include Mario 64). Excellent control,
appealing graphics, and it's extremely long. (Why isn't there a save option?)
Lots of different powerups are available and there are many hidden areas to
find. The stages with giant enemies are so cool!
<dt>Swords and Serpents
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>If you can tolerate the lame graphics and control in the 3D mazes long 
enough to get into a battle, you might enjoy this game, but I doubt you can.
<a name="t">
<dt>Tagin' Dragon
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Maneuver around a maze and try to catch other dragons by the tail. Bad
control and pathetic graphics.
<dt>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Awful animation, sluggish control, and frustrating gameplay. Not the
worst game on the NES but it's trying hard to be.
<dt>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Arcade Game
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>This game is too different and too good to be considered part of the same
series as the first. TMNT2 moves to a totally different genre. The graphics
are fantastic (parallax scrolling?!), the gameplay is fast and enjoyable, it 
allows two players at once, and with 10 stages it's even longer than the arcade.
Rather repetitive but that's the game's only fault.
<dt>Terra Cresta
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Although it has a unique system of adding parts onto your ship to power up
and even the ability to edit the formation, it's graphically primitive and 
none too playable.
<dt>Tetris (Nintendo)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>I don't have to tell you what a thoroughly addictive game Tetris can be,
but some versions are poor implementations of a great concept. Nintendo's
isn't one of them, with great control and the most appealing graphics of any
version for any system...
<dt>Tetris (Tengen)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 95/100</b>
<dd>...But the version Nintendo denied us by suing Tengen to remove their
version from circulation is that much better. I don't like the darker colors
as well but Tengen's version offers more play options and a two player 
simultaneous mode. I understand Nintendo's reasons for their actions, but
fuck them for rubbing salt in the wound by bringing out an inferior product.
<dt>Thrilla's Surfari
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>This fast-paced skateboarding game might be fun if it weren't so damn
difficult! Half the time you don't even see the log in your path before you're
face down in the gravel.
<dt>Tiger Heli
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Flickery, poorly animated graphics and sluggish gameplay. The weapons system
lacks, too.
<dt>Tiny Toon Adventures
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Play as Buster, Plucky, or Dizzy (cool!) in a Mario-esque platformer.
Fast, playable, and the graphics are appealing though they could be more
colorful.
<dt>Top Gun
<dd>Game Type: Flight Simulator
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>An action-oriented flight sim. Not much gameplay and of course 3D
graphics on the NES always suck. Carrier landings are extremely frustrating
until you master them.
<dt>Toobin'
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Steer your inner tube down dangerous rivers. Chuck your limited supply
of beer cans at enemies and pick up more if you're able. Decent graphics and
gameplay.
<dt><a href="trog.html">Trog</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The formula is similar but it's no Pac-Man. The control leaves a bit to
be desired. Still, the wide variety of stages and obstacles and the two player
simultaneous option help quite a bit.
<dt>Trojan
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Notable for giving you a positionable shield as well as a sword, but the
resulting complexity of the controls makes a difficult game that much harder.
Still fun to play and well worth a look even though it's old as the hills.
<a name="u">
<dt>Ultimate Stuntman
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>The overhead-view driving sequence that opens the game is pretty fun but
unfortunately it dissolves into a sluggish platformer in the next stage. Try
but don't buy.
<a name="v">
<dt>Vice - Project Doom
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Fast-paced with decent action and great graphics. A lifesaver if you've played
Ninja Gaiden to death.
<dt>Videomation
<dd>Game Type: Drawing
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>The only widely available paint program for the NES. Has a decent tool 
set with fill, line, circle, etc. It is of course severely limited by the 
NES's small color palette, and the animation tools are weak.
<dt>Vindicators
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A unique but unimpressive tank game. Decent graphics but sluggish and
frustrating gameplay.
<a name="w">
<dt>Waffle Crisp
<dd>Game Type: Breakfast Cereal
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Mimics real waffles amazingly well. The shape, taste, and even the texture
(after soaking in milk for a bit) and all exactly like waffles with syrup.
Could be more filling, though, and the nutritional value isn't the best.
<dt>Werewolf
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>This game had potential but the final product is frustrating as hell to
play. Decent graphics, though.
<dt>Willow
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A Zelda clone with cool graphics and good gameplay.
<dt>Wizards and Warriors
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Ugly graphics and frustrating gameplay. It's not an awful game but it will
drive you crazy after you play it a while.
<dt>Wrecking Crew
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A unique mix of Pac-Man and puzzle solving. You must completely demolish
an old building, but you must figure out a certain path to take so you don't
miss knocking down any walls. Great gameplay makes up for the simplistic 
graphics. Dozens of stages are included and you can design (but not save) 
your own.
<dt>Wurm
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Has a zillion sub-games and doesn't really do any of them right. Nice
graphics and the gameplay's not hideous but...
<a name="x">
<dt>Xenophobe
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Decent graphics but it's laden with flicker. The gameplay is passable and
is helped by a two player simultaneous mode.
<dt>Xevious
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Aaack! The graphics and music are awful! A game this simplistic has to
have addictive gameplay to back it up and Xevious does not. Why does anyone
consider this a classic?
<dt>Xexyz
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Yecch. A semi-cute platformer with awkward control and a boring shooter
mixed in. Might appeal to you but not if you have good taste.
<a name="y">
<dt>Yo! Noid
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Highly playable and very challenging. Too bad that frustrating ice stage
with the slippery floors appears so early in the game.
<dt>Young Indiana Jones
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Decent graphics, great gameplay, and a fairly fast pace. Definitely
worth a try.

<dt><a href="zanac.html">Zanac</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 95/100</b>
<dd>Intense speed, great graphics, and an unbelievably big selection of weapons
make this the greatest shooter to appear on the NES - better than many 16 and 
32-bit shooters. Highly addictive.
<dt><a href="zelda.html">Zelda</a>
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 95/100</b>
<dd>This game created its own genre. Graphically primitive but the gameplay
is so addictive that no clone since has measured up. (Not even Zelda 3, and 
Zelda 64 looks doubtful.) A tough second quest with new dungeons is made 
available after you beat the game, guaranteeing it'll keep you busy awhile.
