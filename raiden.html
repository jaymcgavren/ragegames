<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Raiden II is a top-notch shooter. I'm not especially thrilled about having
Raiden 1 included on the CD, since it pales in comparison, but it's a nice
bonus. My review will focus on the sequel, however.</p>

<p>Seibu Kaihatsu, in designing the Raiden series, seems to have focused on 
providing a sense of realism. Not necessarily realistic graphics, just 
realistic settings, and realistic explosions (in the sense that they are
really big, really loud, and send lots of shrapnel flying all over). Enemy 
ships don't merely flash and disappear, they go down in flames, and if they
crash into a forest or a building they knock great holes into it. This 
attention to detail is a sure sign either of pyromania or great game design.</p>

<p>Controls are absolutely flawless. They need to be, because surviving the
barrage of bullets the bosses dish out requires very precise maneuvering.
Even ordinary enemies can flood the screen at times, so expect to be kept
on your toes. With eight stages, the game is decent lengthwise, and  
difficulty settings ranging from easy to masochistic ensure there's some 
replay value. The fact that two players can play simultaneously doesn't  
hurt, either. There are two types of missiles (both rather puny), and two 
types of smart bombs (both very impressive). I wish there were more weapon 
types. With only three main weapons, this is the one area in which this 
game scores lower than other shooters. </p>

<p>A couple other areas where the game <b>doesn't</b> shine...
The arcade music is unbearable but you can select remixed music, which is
passable. Aside from the explosions the sound is merely average.
Flying debris from enemy wrecks can sometimes be confused with bullets.
The options to scale the screen image are nice, since you can set the image 
sideways to duplicate the look of an arcade monitor. Most TVs can't be
set on their side without color distortions, though, and the image is 
distorted horizontally when viewed normally. (I have tried the game with a 
Commodore monitor on its side, and I have to say it's even more enjoyable
than usual that way.) I was horrified to see actual <b>slowdown</b> when
the action got really intense, but that was more disappointment with my
beloved Playstation than with the game. Finally, there isn't an ending per se, 
so don't play through the game expecting to be rewarded with one.
(They should have saved the semi-nifty intro sequence to use as an ending.)</p>

<p>Overall, though, the game is so thoroughly enjoyable that no shooter fan can
afford to pass it up. My decision is not yet finalized, but I think I may
actually like it better than Space Megaforce, my previous favorite shooter.</p>

<h2>Game Shark Codes</h2>
<p>A neat trick: use the codes for full power on all three main weapons
at once. They all fire at the exact same time, and the system doesn't 
crash even when the screen gets crowded!</p>
