<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: First-Person Maze</b>
<br>You look through the eyes of a lone Space Marine as he works his way
through a maze of corridors, blasting any demons he comes across. You
can move in the direction you're facing, turn, move sideways, and even
fall off ledges or climb stairs (unlike Wolfenstein 3-D).

<p><b>Gameplay: 95/100</b>
<br>
Excellent. Even PCs with a control pad couldn't have worked as nicely
as the Playstation pad, and keyboards... ugh. With separate buttons to
advance, turn, strafe, run, open doors, and fire, it takes a bit to
get used to, but eventually the player can use all these in tandem to
pull off really complex maneuvers. You can dodge a fireball and leap
back into a firing position without having to re-aim. You can work
your way around the edge of a room while firing into its center all
the while. Being able to pull moves like that makes Doom incredibly
fun. With over 50 huge levels from Doom 1 and 2, you won't beat it
right away, either.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>
The framerate is smooth, the viewing window is much bigger than most
PCs could handle. The atmosphere is dark and brooding. Play this one
at night with the lights off! My only gripe with graphics is the poor
animation and scaling on the enemy sprites, but any version of Doom
has that.

<p><b>Sound: 95/100</b>
<br>
Thoom! Thoom! Gunfire never sounded this good. This is another game
where the sound is so good your ears will help you survive as much
as your eyes. You can hear the enemies when they spot you and hear
each shot fired at you. The music is quiet so you can hear what's
going on around you, but it's better that way - subtle, and very, very
creepy. (My favorite track has a crying baby somewhere in the distance
that twists into the wail of a demon.)

<p><b>Overall: 95/100</b>
<br>
Highly playable, very long, and the biggest scare of your video gaming
life. I cannot recommend Doom strongly enough to Playstation owners.
