<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Platform</b>
<br>A typical Castlevania game - if there is such a thing. You play as 
Alucard (cool!), the vampire from Castlevania III. Obviously, since this 
isn't a Belmont, you won't have the traditional whip. (Except in the 
intro, where you play as Richter from the first Dracula X.) Alucard uses 
rapiers, dirks, and shields in addition to all the usual special 
items like the boomerang and holy water. This is more an adventure than 
an action game; as in Metroid you must travel all over the castle, 
searching for items to allow you to progress past various obstacles. For 
each monster you kill you gain experience which will give you more strength 
and stamina among other things.

<p><b>Gameplay: 60/100</b>
<br>Dracula X could have been a lot more fun than it turned out. The 
control is excellent, there are lots of moves including a reverse slide 
and blocking with a shield, and the boss designs are decent. But Konami 
just had to turn it into an adventure/RPG. Most enemies take anywhere from 
five to a dozen hits to kill when you first encounter them, meaning they 
can plow through all your attempts to defend yourself and hit you anyway. 
Trekking back and forth and back and forth across the castle to find 
different items gets to be a pain eventually. (I was horrified, not 
pleased, to learn there was a second castle after I beat the first.)

<p><b>Graphics: 80/100</b>
<br>The backgrounds are bland and dark but the graphics are amazing in 
every other aspect. The animation on Alucard is incredibly smooth. Every 
enemy seems to have its own way of dying, usually in a fountain of blood 
or fire. The special effects are some of the best ever seen on the 
Playstation or any other system. Too bad about those backgrounds, though; 
they make an otherwise visually spectacular game look decidedly 
sixteen-bit.

<p><b>Sound: 90/100</b>
<br>Those who remember Castlevania IV's jazzy soundtrack won't be 
disappointed, but DX's music is also influenced by R&B, classical, and even 
heavy metal (not to mention those rockin' harpsichord tunes). The sound 
effects are excellent as well. There's even speech for the cinemas by 
great voice actors (all in Japanese, of course; let's hope the English 
voice actors are equally good).

<p><b>Overall: 70/100</b>
<br>Even Super Metroid wore thin for me after a while, but if you're still 
playing that you won't be disappointed with Dracula X. I for one find  
DX frustrating and I hope to God the next Castlevania is pure action. It 
certainly is impressive at first, though, and the graphics and music are 
great throughout. Import it if you <b>have</b> to be the first kid on the 
block to own it, but I suggest waiting for its U.S. release on October 1. 
Better reserve a copy in advance; the fact that I don't like it won't 
stop it from being a complete sellout.
