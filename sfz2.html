<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Fighting</b>
<br>Latest in a series that a genre grew up around. Allows blocking in
mid-jump, a power meter that allows hidden Super Combos to be executed when
full, and the new Custom Combos: a free-form version of the super combo that
lets the player choose their own moves to air-juggle an opponent.
<br>

<p><b>Gameplay: 97/100</b>
<br>I won't bother saying much here because the game is arcade perfect. If
you've played Street Fighter Alpha 2 in the arcades, you've played Street
Fighter Zero 2 for the Playstation. (That's a good thing.) The quality of
the conversion hasn't even changed much from SFA1. All the configuration
options are still here, as is the nifty training mode. I am pleased to add
that loading time has been reduced, not increased.
<br>

<p><b>Graphics: 95/100</b>
<br>Okay, I do have one tentative complaint here. It seems to me like the
animation is missing a frame or two. It doesn't detract in the least from
the game, though, and you'll never spot the difference if you're not
looking. Ah, at last, the backgrounds are of decent quality and number!
<br>

<p><b>Sound: 90/100</b>
<br>Not astounding but very high quality. I had been dreading playing the
import version with messed up music, but was pleased to discover the music
is swap-friendly now. The remixes are great (except for Chun Li's, which
they messed up <i>bad</i>). Voice samples are perfect.
<br>

<p><b>Overall: 95/100</b>
<br>If you don't import this game or at least get the American version,
don't presume to call yourself a fighting game fan. This game is everything
Alpha 1 should have been and more. A fantastic selection of well-developed
characters, tons of moves, the fearsome Custom Combos... If you do get the
Japanese version, don't worry, you can get by later without the American.
The only differences are changes in some character names, Japanese text
for the story, and of course a slightly different title.
