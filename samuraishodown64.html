<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 3D Fighting</b>
<br>Vaguely like Toshinden in play style. Uses standard 2D movements 
and blocking style, but adds the use of a 3D Escape button for dodges 
towards or away from the screen. Some arenas have walls you can knock 
your opponent against, or edges for fighters to topple off of.

<p><b>Gameplay: 40/100</b>
<br>As far as I am concerned, this is not part of the Samurai Shodown 
series. The SamSho games represent the pinnacle of gameplay, which this 
game is definitely not. The pace is horribly sluggish, the moves are 
awkward, and the characters are totally imbalanced. Sure, all the usual 
extras are here - powerful super moves, two different sets of special 
moves for each character, the ability to catch yourself if you fall 
off a ledge, etc, etc. But if the basic play is total garbage, all 
this effort is for nothing.

<p><b>Graphics: 50/100</b>
<br>If you were only to look at still shots this game might show some 
promise graphically. The backgrounds are colorful, the character designs 
are of course extremely cool (except that the polygonal versions look 
rather blocky), and the moves are of course as flashy as ever. During 
fights floors sometimes collapse, dropping you into a new area. There 
are even 2D cutaways for some of the more powerful attacks, showing 
the attack in pencil drawings or colorful brush paintings. (The effect 
is quite cool.)
<br>If you try to impose a weak graphic engine on all this wonderful 
artistic design, though, you wind up with a mess. The backgrounds have 
very little detail, and wind up looking more like cardboard cutouts 
than anything else. The framerate is quite poor, maybe 15-20 frames per 
second by my estimation. Seams between the polygons are quite evident, 
especially where vertices meet. (The characters often look as if they 
have a bad case of dandruff.) SNK's graphic artists certainly tried, 
but they could have done far better with a 2D game.

<p><b>Sound: 80/100</b>
<br>Some of the new musical scores are quite impressive, mixing a 
classical Japanese flavor with cool modern beats. Voice samples as usual 
abound, although the quality is slightly lower than in previous games. 
Overall the audio is a far more worthy effort than the graphics or 
gameplay.

<p><b>Overall: 40/100</b>
<br>There may be a better way to play this game than pure button-mashing, 
but in playing for two hours I didn't find it. It was random guesswork 
as to whether a given special move would be effective at any given time, 
and eventually I just chose one or two of my best moves for each character 
and started repeating them, to great effect.
<br>Of course, even if the gameplay were decent SS64 could never stand up 
to comparison with the graphics of Virtua Fighter 3 or even Tekken 3 and 
Soul Edge. (Which run on Playstation hardware, for Pete's sake!) I find it 
unbelievable that SNK was willing to release this game into arcades in its 
current form.
<br>Of course, the first effort on any new hardware isn't going to take 
advantage of all its capabilities. I'm sure the new architecture is 
(partly) to blame for SS64's sorry state. So Neophytes shouldn't give up 
on the Neo Geo 64 just yet, especially since I hear it has some nice 2D 
capabilities. I sincerely hope SNK will use these for their next Samurai 
Shodown game.
