<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 3D Racing</b>
<br>Hovercar racing set in the future. Race around a track, being careful
not to hit the sides too much, or your craft may explode. Use jump ramps to
clear gaps in the track.
<br>

<p><b>Gameplay: 90/100</b>
<br>The controls are too tight to be realistic (what does a hovercar handle
like, anyway?) but reality aside, the gameplay is very solid. No missiles
or mines or anything of that sort but you'll be too busy negotiating tough
turns to worry about that sort of thing. Lots and lots of tracks available -
3 classes with eight tracks each. Best records are saved for each track, and
a time trial mode is available.

<p><b>Graphics: 90/100</b>
<br>The graphics are showing their age a bit now but they still look decent.
The track consists of a flat plane that is scaled and rotated according to
your current position. The graphics are very colorful and the backgrounds
are simplistic but beautiful.

<p><b>Sound: 80/100</b>
<br>Not too fancy but the music and sound are pretty high quality. The alarm
that goes off when your ship is badly damaged may drive you crazy if it goes
too long.

<p><b>Overall: /100</b>
<br>Time was when this was the most graphically amazing racing game in
existence. That's certainly no longer the case, but F-Zero still has the
excellent gameplay it needs to become a classic.
