<dt>Fantasy Zone
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Pretty and colorful but I got tired of this one rather quickly. There's no cool weapons 
and the Defender-style control can be frustrating.

<dd>Actually "shooter" probably isn't a totally accurate classification. GD bears a strong 
resemblance to Missile Command, except that you're firing from a sattelite that appears on the 
screen and must be moved out of the path of incoming obstacles. Trying to keep your sattelite safe 
and not miss any targets can quickly become quite a juggling act. Missile Command fans should 
definitely try it, but it's not for everyone.
<dt>Golvellius - Valley of Doom
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Probably the best Zelda clone on the Master System but that's not saying much. It's passable but 
nowhere near as addictive as its predecessor.

<dt>Phantasy Star
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A combination of overhead-view and 3D maze RPGs. For an 8-bit game this is extremely 
impressive. The graphics are beautiful and the attacks of the many enemies are all animated. 
Although the mazes all look identical, the movement animations are surprisingly smooth. 
Unfortunately there's almost no story or character development. Also, no matter how many enemies 
are fighting you, they're displayed onscreen as if there's only one. (This can get really 
confusing.) These gripes aside, you'll be convinced you're playing a 16-bit RPG, and it'll 
entertain you every bit as much as a 32-bit one.
<dt>Power Strike
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Yes, Compile even has a shooter on the Master System, and it's good enough to rival Zanac. 
The powerup system is marvelous and the graphics are beautiful. Shooter fans should seek out a 
copy if they can, though it won't be easy.

<dd>Game Type: Light Gun
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Who needs Virtua Cop? A far cooler and more addictive game is available for Sega's first 
system. Go after beautifully animated targets like ducks, balloons, and spaceships. Miss and 
you'll blast holes in the backdrop. Simplistic but SG offers lots of variety.
