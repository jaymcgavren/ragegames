<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: 2D Fighting</b>
<br>A basic SF2-style fighting game with standard SF2 controls. As in 
SamSho you can press B, B to hop away from your opponent. You can 
customize the characters' strengths by giving ability points to each 
of six different attributes.

<p><b>Gameplay: 50/100</b>
<br>Pretty comparable to Street Fighter II, but not nearly so complex 
or well-polished. Most characters only have two or three special moves, 
many of which are rather awkward. Worse still, the projectiles rely 
on magic power to launch, and magic power can run out in the middle of 
a fight. While this helps keep fireball wars from breaking out, it's 
very frustrating to attempt a special move several times and have your 
character left wide open when it fails. About the only interesting and 
unique gameplay feature is the ability to determine any character's 
strengths and weaknesses (like their HP and attack power) by 
distributing attribute points.

<p><b>Graphics: 70/100</b>
<br>The stages are great but there really aren't enough of them (a 
couple are just nighttime versions of backgrounds seen in daylight 
elsewhere). The character animation could be a lot better, too. Colorful 
and cute but not very impressive visuals.

<p><b>Sound: 50/100</b>
<br>The game has lots of lengthy voice samples of passable quality, but 
they can be repeated enough during a match to get annoying. The music 
is upbeat and fits in with the cute atmosphere, but isn't especially 
remarkable.

<p><b>Overall: 50/100</b>
<br>Fans of the Sailor Moon series (of which I am admittedly not one) 
probably won't be too disappointed, especially with all the nice artwork. 
It definitely won't be the game itself that keeps players' interest, 
though. The gameplay is weak, and the small character roster and short 
moves list don't help matters. No way it's worth the price of import 
unless you are a hardcore fan.
