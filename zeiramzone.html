<h2>Review</h2>

<p><b>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler</b>
<img src="zeiramzone.jpg" align=right>
<br>A mix of Street Fighter and Double Dragon. The heroine runs along 
and beats the crap out of hapless robots. She can jump between two or 
three planes of the background a la Guardian Heroes, and has a few 
Street Fighter-style special moves at her disposal.

<p><b>Gameplay: 50/100</b>
<br>I'm rather disappointed. The control seems all right, and the 
gameplay shows promise. But Zeiram Zone is one of those games that 
strikes me as being only 90% finished, like it could use a bit more 
tweaking. Some of the special moves don't seem to have quite the range 
they should, you can get caught in the wrong spot and get beaten to 
death by an enemy before you can even do anything, and some of the 
bosses are cheap as hell. The code to let you play as any of several 
enemies is a nice addition, but the basic gameplay is just too weak. 
So close, yet so far...

<p><b>Graphics: 50/100</b>
<br>The immediate reaction of those who know and love Iria from the 
anime will be: "That isn't Iria." Well, it is, but this is a CG 
representation of Iria from the live-action movie. (Again, I'm rather 
disappointed.) Her rendering in the FMV sequences is of only passable 
quality, but in the game she looks great. Her special moves are 
enhanced with light trails, and the character animation is well 
designed. Too bad many of the enemies don't look as good as she does. 
The framerate and backgrounds could be better, too.

<p><b>Sound: 70/100</b>
<br>The (non swap-friendly) music is hardly a masterpiece but it 
complements the game nicely. The sound effects and voice samples are 
of decent quality, too.

<p><b>Overall: 50/100</b>
<br>I'd had some very high hopes for Zeiram Zone, but I'm afraid I 
couldn't recommend purchasing it if it came out in the U.S., much less 
importing it. There's just not enough substance here to make it worth 
replaying.

<h2>Codes</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Play as Enemies
<dd>At the Game Start/Option screen, highlight Game Start, do a 360 
degree clockwise motion on the control pad, and press T. (It's all right 
if the menu choice shifts, and you can repeat the sequence as often as 
needed.) The Game Start option should turn red. Begin a game and a menu 
should appear where you can select from several enemies to play as.
