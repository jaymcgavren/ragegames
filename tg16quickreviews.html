<dt><a href="aeroblasters.html">Aero Blasters</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Not much of a powerup system but perhaps that's part of the game's intrigue. Your 
only weapon with any decent strength is the main cannon, forcing you to get in enemies' 
faces to take them out. Beautiful graphics and fun to play.
<dt>Alien Crush
<dd>Game Type: Pinball
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Pinball for those with short attention spans. If a two-screen board with tons of 
bizarre obstacles isn't enough for you, there's also several different bonus rounds. 
It's a good thing this is a pinball game because otherwise AC would be very disturbing. 
This game is <i>gross</i>. Egg pods, blood vessels, you name it. The graphics look good, though.

<dt><a href="blazinglazers.html">Blazing Lazers</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>An excellent shooter with a great powerup system from the masters of the genre, Compile. 
The graphics are merely okay (rather than outstanding like I've come to expect) but otherwise 
this is one any shooter fan needs to own. When you find the hidden difficulty setting, look out!
<dt>Bravoman
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Eyecchh! Those graphics are awful! And why do they incessantly use those grainy voice 
samples? At least the gameplay's passable, although I'll take Kung Fu over this any day.
<a name="c">
<a name="d">
<dt>Devil's Crush
<dd>Game Type: Pinball
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>If Alien Crush wasn't enough pure pinball madness for you, this sucker offers a huge three 
screen playfield (it scrolls rather than jumping from screen to screen this time) and even more 
bonus rounds. You'll see something new every time you play. A must for any pinball junkie.
<dt>Double Dungeons
<dd>Game Type: 3D Maze RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Rather simplistic but the scrolling is very smooth and the battles extremely fast-paced. 
If you're the type to actually enjoy being lost in a 3D maze you'll love this, but it's 
definitely not for claustrophobes; you never, ever leave the dungeon.

<dt>Keith Courage in Alpha Zones
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>You can't buy a TurboGrafx used anymore without the prior owner begging you to take his 
copy of this. It's not horrible, just nothing special, and it's very, very common. A dollar 
is too much to pay for a copy.
<dt>Klax
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The tiles appear a little too narrow onscreen and may make you momentarily a little unsure 
of which column you're dropping them into. There's also no added music like the NES version has. 
But who cares? This is still the premiere home version of the insanely addictive and ridiculously fast-paced 
arcade game. If you want to see Klax in all its colorful glory, get yourself the Turbo version.
<a name="l">
<dt>Legendary Axe
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>The backgrounds are a visual feast but the character design needs a bit of work. The game 
itself could have been pretty playable but it's difficult to defend yourself against the hordes 
of enemies onscreen when each of them takes two or more hits to kill. Frustrating.
<a name="m">
<dt>Military Madness
<dd>Game Type: War Sim
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Easy to learn, fun to play, and given its lunar setting, it won't bore those who aren't 
ordinarily into the genre. Pretty graphics, too. Many strategy games still use MM's conventions 
today. If you're looking to get into war sims, this is the place to start. I still don't 
understand why a multitap is necessary for a game where you could just hand off the controller, 
though.
<a name="n">
<dt>Neutopia
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>This is about as blatant a Zelda clone as you can get. All the conventions are exactly the 
same, right down to the use of bombs. Of course the graphics are prettier, and the villagers more 
numerous and talkative (and better translated). But alas, your sword doesn't have nearly a wide 
enough range, and trying to hit any enemy can be a frustrating (and fatal) experience. Woe that 
this one vital area is the only part of the game any less than perfect.
<dt>Ninja Spirit
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>You have several cool weapons at your disposal and a couple of ghostly assistants (just like 
Ninja Gaiden II). My only gripes are that the jumps are ridiculously high and the difficulty curve 
makes a severe jump after a few levels. Aside from that the gameplay is marvelous. 
<a name="p">
<dt>Parasol Stars
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Man, and you thought Bubble Bobble was wierd... The third game in the series has you catching 
enemies on top of a parasol to stun them and then tossing them at other enemies. It might sound 
fun but I didn't enjoy it much, especially due to the usual floaty jumps. It is purty to look at, 
though; the graphics are cute and very colorful. Bubble Bobble fans will love it.
<a name="q">
<a name="r">
<dt>R-Type
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A decent title for its time but this sluggish shooter doesn't stand up too well against 
comparison to more modern fare, including others in the R-Type series.
<a name="s">
<dt>Side Arms
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Fairly playable and the weapon systems are decent but the graphics leave much to be desired. 
Pretty common so you can probably get it cheap and it's probably worth it.
<dt>Sinistron
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>An intriguing and original weapon setup. You have an adjustable shield on the front of your 
ship, which can be opened wider for a wider shot spread but less defense, or closed completely 
to get a single, powerful shot and near invulnerability to bullets (from the front, anyway). 
The system of having some bullets kill you and others deflected doesn't quite work, though. It's 
only more frustrating when a bullet does get through. You'll need the infinite continues you're 
given; later stages are ridiculously hard (though not always cheap).
<dt>Splatterhouse
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>The designers' first priority must have been to make this sucker as disgusting as possible. 
Gameplay was definitely not high on the list. The game is sluggish and really not that much fun. 
If you're looking to horrify friends and family, though, this is the game to get. Blood, slime, 
and tentacles are everywhere.
<a name="t">
<dt>TimeBall
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Move pieces of tube around to keep a ball rolling. Not very fancy graphics or sound but this 
isn't the sort of game that requires them. It'll provide you with near-endless challenge if you 
like this sort of thing, and near-endless frustration if you don't.
<dt>Tricky Kick
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Kick tiles (or animals, or whatever) of the same type into each other to make them disappear. 
If you complete this game I suggest you apply for Mensa immediately. Those who've played Sokoban 
know what I mean. Colorful but not very detailed graphics. For masochists only.
<a name="u">
<a name="v">
<dt>Veigues Tactical Gladiator
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Awful gameplay, graphics, and sound. Are HuCards recyclable or should I just pitch it?
