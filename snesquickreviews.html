<dt>Accelebrid (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 3D Chase-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>It appears that even a cartridge-based system is not immune to 
infection by FMV shooters. That's right, Accelebrid is a 3D shooter 
a la Space Harrier projected over looping prerendered backgrounds. Space 
limitations make this video decidedly pixellated, but even if the graphics 
looked good it wouldn't make up for the hideous gameplay.
<dt>ActRaiser
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform/Simulation
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Probably the strangest mix of genres ever seen in a game, but it's
still an excellent title. You clear an area of monsters in a highly
playable platformer, then build a city there while fending off further
monster attacks. The graphics and classical music are great. A must.
<dt>ActRaiser 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>How the mighty have fallen... If Actraiser 1 was a must, the sequel 
is a must not. Gone are the city-building sequences, which might be
bearable if the gameplay weren't ruined in the platformer areas. Beautiful
graphics and nice classical music by Yuzo Koshiro, but it's not enough.
<dt>Aero the Acro-Bat
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Sunsoft is trying to create their own Sonic the Hedgehog, but Aero
doesn't quite cut it. The gameplay is nowhere near as well thought out,
the attacks are strange, and the scenery is boring. OK but not great.
<dt>Aero Fighters
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A less-than-perfect port of the arcade shooter. The graphics are bland 
and the animation stinks but the gameplay is excellent. Worth consideration 
for die hard shooter fans.
<dt><a href="aladdin.html">Aladdin</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Excellent! Aside from the pathetic attempts at cinemas this game is
perfect. Although the character graphics aren't as well done as on the 
Genesis version the animation is just as good, and the gameplay is
arguably better. A bit too easy but still a must see.
<dt>Albert Odyssey (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Strategy/RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics and audio are quite reminiscient of Zelda 3. (In other 
words, they're good.) The game is one endless battle; to journey to the 
next town your characters must fight their way across a hex grid riddled with 
monsters. The map endlessly scales and rotates during these battles, which 
can get annoying. Overall - good, but there's no guarantee you'll like it.
<dt><a href="alcahest.html">Alcahest (Super Famicom)</a>
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The character animation is a bit awkward but the graphics are nice and
the gameplay is decent. Only worth importing if you can get it cheap,
though.
<dt>Animaniacs
<dd>Game Type: Adventure
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Colorful graphics, awesome music, and of course the coolest characters 
ever to grace a TV screen. Hilarious throughout, very much in the spirit 
of the show. Not exactly addictive but well worth a try.
<dt>Arcade's Greatest Hits
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>This one isn't an emulation like its Playstation counterpart, so the 
games aren't arcade perfect. It also doesn't include Bubbles, so the PS 
version is definitely the one to go for if you can. If not, this will 
suffice, since these five classic games are (nearly) as addictive as ever.
<dt>Aretha II (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Beautiful animesque artwork, lush scenery, and a semi-original approach 
to first-person battles where enemies can attack from the sides and the rear.
But the gameplay is still hardly exciting and the enemy designs are lame. 
In the age of Wild Arms and FF7 this just isn't worth the trouble to import.
<dt><a href="arkanoiddia.html">Arkanoid - Doh it Again</a>
<dd>Game Type: Ball and Paddle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Could have been a classic. Beautiful graphics, awesome new powerups, 
and 99 stages. But it's just too damn easy. The ball moves so slowly there's 
almost no chance you'll miss it, even on the highest difficulty setting. 
Rent first even if you're a fan of the series.
<dt>Astroboy (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Awful graphics and frustrating gameplay. Stay <b>far</b> away from 
this one.


<a name="b">

<dt>Bahamut Lagoon (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Strategy/RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>A brilliant RPG by Square. Movement on the battlefield is handled a-la 
Shining Force, but any hand-to-hand combat takes place in a Final-Fantasy 
style battle sequence. The art is reminiscient of FF3, and the special 
effects are phenomenal. Not as deep as Tactics Ogre but every bit as 
enjoyable. Worthy of import.
<dt>Battleclash
<dd>Game Type: Light Gun Shooting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Requires the Super Scope to play. Fairly playable but graphically weak,
especially compared to Metal Combat. Try the sequel instead.
<dt>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Very impressive graphically but just as frustratingly difficult as its
predecessor. If you liked the first Battletoads you'll by no means be 
disappointed but it's too tough for me.
<dt>Battletoads / Double Dragon
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>The graphics were incredible on the NES, but there should have been
at least some improvement when porting it to the SNES. At least the 
difficulty is better balanced than in Battlemaniacs.
<dt>Blackthorne
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Like Out of this World or Flashback, you must plan each move before you
act. If you're willing to put up with the sluggish and sometimes 
frustrating play it's a decent game. Polished graphics, good sound, and a 
grim atmosphere.
<dt>Blazeon
<dd>Game Type: Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>The idea of melding with enemy ships and using their weapons is cool,
sure. Too bad every other aspect of the game sucks. The graphics are
awful, the music is lame, and the gameplay is boring.
<dt>B.O.B.
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Fairly playable, and the main character is cool, but the occasional
cheap hit brings this game's score down.
<dt>Breath of Fire
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>It's no FF3 but the graphics are pretty well done, and there's a good
selection of characters. Zillions of sub-quests guarantee it'll keep you
busy for a long time (although the game begins to drag on a bit towards 
the end).
<dt>Breath of Fire II
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Unfortunately Capcom handled the translation themselves instead of 
licensing it to Square like the first. As a result the text quality is
horrible. At least it offers some graphic improvements over the original.
<dt>Bubsy
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Mix Mario's poor defensive abilities with Sonic's speed and you have...
a disaster. The graphics are nice, the main character is funny, and the pace
is speedy, but the need to land precisely on enemies' heads gets tedious
after a few stages.
<dt>Bubsy II
<dd>Game Type: 2D platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>More of the same. If you liked the first you'll like this.
<dt>Bust-a-Move
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>A bizarre mix of billiards and Columns that actually works. Shoot
sticky bubbles into groups of the same color to clear them. Two player
versus mode is best but the one player version is good too.

<a name="c">

<dt>Cacoma Knight in Bizyland
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>If you can stand the cutesy atmosphere it's a pretty good clone
of Qix. Nice, colorful graphics but too kawaii for me.
<dt>Castlevania IV
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Probably the best Castlevania on any platform to date. Decent
graphics, awesome gameplay, cool (and very unique) music, and some nice
special effects.
<dt>Castlevania - Dracula X
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The anime-style approach to Castlevania is decidedly welcome, but
DracX is a downgrade from Castlevania IV in both graphics and gameplay.
Still worth checking out because, hey, it's Castlevania.
<dt>Chaos in the Windy City
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>It's a decent platformer so I'm willing to forgive the Michael 
Jordan license. Nice graphics and character animation. The gameplay has 
potential but doesn't quite flow perfectly.
<dt>Chrono Trigger
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Aside from the poor character animation this game is practically 
perfect. The backgrounds are beautiful, the music is fantastic, and the
special effects are eye-popping. Lots of different endings, too.
<dt>Clay Fighter
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The characters are all digitized claymation figures, and as a result
the graphics are awesome, but of course the animation is hideous. Still
a decent Street Fighter clone, definitely worth a rental.
<dt>Clay Fighter 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Features more characters than the first but there are no animation
or gameplay improvements to speak of. Don't bother unless you liked the
first.
<dt>Contra III - The Alien Wars
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Nice graphics, great playability, but man, is it tough! As if
standard mode wasn't bad enough you have to beat it on the highest
difficulty to get the good ending.
<dt>Cotton 100% (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A cutesy shooter featuring a witch on a broomstick as the main character. 
Lots of powerups, options which can fly in different formations, and overall 
decent gameplay. The graphic style doesn't totally appeal to me but it 
sure is colorful. Don't rush to import it but it's worth a play, especially 
for Gradius fans.
<dt>Crayon Shin-Chan (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Based on the only anime series I know of with an exhibitionist hero. 
Several of your special attacks consist of mooning the enemy to death. 
(No I don't think the elephant impression is in this game, thankfully.) 
Your only main attack is to jump on enemies' heads, which is difficult in 
a pseudo-3D game. Colorful and cartoony but not worthwhile gameplaywise.
<dt>Crazy Chase
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Speedy, humorous, visually appealing, and way too short. I would 
heartily recommend this game if it had more than 5 stages. Still, it
does have a fair amount of replay value and may be worth a look.
<dt>Cross Dimension 0079 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View RPG
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>A mech strategy game, vaguely similar to Shining Force. Virtually all 
of the battle menus are in English but of course all dialogue is Japanese. 
Strangely enough special moves can be accessed while attacking with Street 
Fighter-like controller commands. The gameplay is passable but not good 
enough to make up for the weak graphics. 
<dt>Cyber Police (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Why import this game when we've got dozens of domestic brawlers 
that are equally lame? Poor animation, annoying music, and frustrating 
and repetitive gameplay.

<a name="d">

<dt>Daffy Duck - The Marvin Missions
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Excellent graphics and sound but the game could flow a bit better.
Another platformer content to be merely average thanks to its license.
<dt>Death & Return of Superman
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Just another pretty face. The graphics are nice but with very few 
moves the game gets boring quick. And since when can a generic thug
punch out the Man of Steel?
<dt>Demon's Crest
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Your character can cling to walls and has a limited ability to glide,
making this one of the more original platformers on the SNES. Nice
graphics, too. Too bad it's so quickly beaten.
<dt>Donkey Kong Country
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Pretty rendered graphics and decent gameplay to boot. Everyone and
their dog's played it, of course, so why do you need my review?
<dt>Donkey Kong Country 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>DK gets ditched in favor of a strange new chick with moves that don't
work into the gameplay as well. I personally like the first better. The 
music is awesome, though, and the graphics are almost 32-bit quality.
<dt>Donkey Kong Country 3
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>OK, the series is getting old, already. And what's the big idea 
getting rid of Diddy Kong for this new brat? Sure, it's a good game, but
definitely not worth it if you own either of the first two.
<dt>Doraemon 4 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Shallow even for a platform game, but still fairly enjoyable. Older 
players will find it way too easy, though; this game is squarely aimed 
at young kids. Cute and colorful.
<dt>Double Dragon V
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Aaack! What a way for a series to die. It's not even a real Double 
Dragon game, for Christ's sake! Lame graphics, lame animation, lame 
gameplay... almost makes Shaq Fu look good.
<dt>Dragon Quest III (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG 
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A remake of the Famicom game with vastly improved graphics and sound. 
If you liked Dragon Warrior III for the NES but are sickened by the 
graphics now you should definitely investigate this, especially since 
you'll be able to navigate without knowing Japanese.
<dt>Dragon Quest VI (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Nice graphics, and of course any gamer knows what to expect of the 
Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest series as far as gameplay. Worth importing.
<dt>Dragon Ball Z 3 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Dragon Ball fanatics will no doubt love it. I didn't. Small characters,
poor graphics, and a split-screen fighting game just doesn't work. Maybe 
if you liked X-Men: COTA...
<dt>Dragon's Lair
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Well, the graphics are very impressive. Can't say the same for the 
gameplay but at least it's not a noninteractive cartoon like the arcade.

<a name="e">

<dt>Earth Defense Force
<dd>Game Type: 2D Shooter
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Fairly playable but to compete against Space Megaforce it needs better
graphics, better sound, and a much better powerup system. Merely average.
<dt>Earthbound
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Don't be scared off by the kiddie character graphics; this is a 
surprisingly mature and decidedly funny RPG. The visuals work well once
you're used to them (dig those battle scenes) and the game itself is very
enjoyable. Too bad the ending is so hopelessly lame, but I'll be watching
the N64 sequel very closely...
<dt>Earthworm Jim
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics and animation are unbelievably good and the game's sick
sense of humor is great. Too bad the gameplay is only average. Still,
this game is an absolute must for rental.
<dt>Earthworm Jim 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Although they're not hideous the redone character animations don't
work as well as the original's. You're also put through too many strange
subgames (including an isometric shooter) too early in the game. At least
the graphics are still further improved.
<dt>Eek the Cat
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>You must try to keep various blind or sleepwalking people from waltzing
into traps. The game starts out easy enough but quickly gets frustrating.
The graphics are nice enough, at least.
<dt>Equinox
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The sequel to the NES's Solstice faces many of the same problems as
the original. The control is awkward, you can't always get a clear look at 
the action, and the game is way too tough. The graphics are awesome, though, and
if you're masochistic enough to like the first you'll like this.
<dt>E.V.O.
<dd>Game Type: Side-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A novel concept. You start as a fish and must earn experience to
evolve your jaws, fins, and eventually your whole body. Eventually you
metamorphose into a land-based mammal and finally a human, if you're
skilled. Graphically unremarkable but the gameplay is good. 

<a name="f">

<dt>F-Zero
<dd>Game Type: 3D Racing
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Back when the SNES first came out this was the graphical creme de la
creme. It no longer claims that title but the colorful look is still great
and the gameplay is outstanding. 
<dt>Faceball 2000
<dd>Game Type: First-Person Shooting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Graphically primitive but an excellent two player game. Besides,
you have to like the concept of shooting up smiley faces. If you can't
link up two Playstations to play Doom this is your solution.
<dt>Fatal Fury 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The idea of jumping between different planes in a fighting game doesn't
really work unless the characters are made of polygons. Still, taken 
strictly as a 2D fighter it's nearly as good as SF2.
<dt>Fatal Fury Special
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 85/100</b>
<dd>It renders Fatal Fury 2 obsolete but Street Fighter players are 
probably used to that. With the largest character roster of any NES 
fighter, it may well be the next best game after Super SF2.
<dt>Fighter's History
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>A pitiful SF2 clone with lame characters and poor graphics. Not worth
a rental when the SNES has so many other great fighters.
<dt>Fighter's History 2 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Only released for Super Famicom. More of the same from the first, 
though the characters seem somewhat improved. Has a much stronger Japanese
flavor than the original.
<dt>Final Fantasy II
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Although FF3 blows this aging game away graphically I don't think I'll 
ever remember its characters or quest as fondly as I do FF2's. FF2 also
doesn't have that depressing second world...
<dt>Final Fantasy III
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Beautiful graphics that border on art, awesome special effects rivaled
only by Chrono Trigger, lots of optional subquests, and some exceedingly
cool characters. People are gonna forget all about this one when FF7 comes 
out but it's still a cool game.
<dt><a href="finalfantasyv.html">Final Fantasy V (Super Famicom)</a>
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Although I have reason to hope that we will never again miss out on a 
Final Fantasy game (American audiences wouldn't stand for it) it is 
regrettable that this is one of the games Square chose not to port. 
Although it doesn't offer many graphic improvements over FF2 its battle
system is considerably deeper than any other FF game, including FF7.
If you're a true fan of the series it's worth importing and wading through
the Japanese text.
<dt>Final Fight
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Fast-paced and fairly playable but not only is there no two player 
option, one of the characters from the arcade game is missing. Perhaps
worst of all the chicks with the handcuffs are gone! Despite
the small moves list this game is still somehow appealing.
<dt>Final Fight Guy
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Exactly the same as Final Fight but Cody has been taken out and 
replaced with the arguably cooler character Guy, who was removed from
the arcade.
<dt>Final Fight 2
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Three characters to choose from and the two player option has 
returned, thankfully. The sequel seems to have lost some of the original's
graphic appeal, however.
<dt>Final Fight 3
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Your choice of four characters, each of which has Street Fighter-style
special moves. It's still no Streets of Rage, though.
<dt>Firepower 2000
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Awesome graphics, great music, cool sound effects, and nice weapon 
systems, plus your choice of two unique vehicles. Add in a two player
option and you have a shooter to (almost) rival Space Megaforce.
<dt>Fist of the North Star 6 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>For a time I managed to convince myself the Game Boy version was 
pretty cool thanks to the nice graphics. Now I know nice graphics don't 
make up for lame gameplay, especially if the animation is lousy.
<dt>Fox Trot
<dd>Game Type: Comic Strip
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>With Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes, and the Far Side all gone to
that big funnies page in the sky this is the only reason I have left to
read the comics. Endearing characters, fast-paced humor, and a great art
style. If your local paper doesn't carry it start writing letters!

<a name="g">

<dt>Gokukyou Parodius (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A whopping 11 "ships" to choose from, each with its own set of
weapons. Hilarious stages and bosses. And all the slowdown of Gradius III.
If you can put up with that last part and you like Gradius you'll love
this game.
<dt>Gradius III
<dd>Game Type: Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Lots of weapons to choose from and nice graphics. Too bad there's so
much slowdown and flicker.
<dt><a href="greatbattle3.html">Great Battle III (Super Famicom)</a>
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Kamen Rider, Ultraman, and others in a colorful and cute but
ultimately boring beat-em-up. Definitely not worth importing.
<dt>Great Battle IV (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>I like this a lot better than its predecessor. The four characters 
each have their own set of special abilities. You can switch between 
them at will, and you'll need to in order to clear the stages. A mix 
of Contra and Lost Vikings with cute graphics and passable gameplay.
<dt>Great Battle V (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform/Crosshair Shooting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Very much like GB4, except that half the stages are crosshair 
shooting a la Cabal or Nam 1975. It's easy to get stuck in some 
places for several minutes until you figure out the obscure solution 
to a puzzle or the weakness of a boss. Not bad but not worth importing.

<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>How can a game like Dr. Mario be made more challenging? How about 
adding "viruses" that move around while you play? Cute characters, nice 
control, and good gameplay. My only complaint is with the bland colors.
<dt>Hyperzone
<dd>Game Type: 3D Chase-View Shooter

gameplay. Yawn.

<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>For months I was excited about the impending release of a sequel to
SoulBlazer. I was disappointed with what I got. While this is arguably
a more polished product, the graphics aren't as appealing, the quest is
too short, the sharp gameplay has lost its edge, and the syrupy sweet 
storyline makes me want to gag.

<dt>Judge Dredd
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>An rather tedious platformer with nothing to keep you playing. It's
not horrible, there's just nothing special about it. Try it if you like
those games that make you explore every nook and cranny of a stage.
<dt>Jungle Book
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

Japanese culture would understand.
<dt>Killer Instinct
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>If you liked the arcade then you'll like this. I acknowledge that it's
a decent product and the rendered graphics look great but I find the 
infinite combos and air juggles to be a ridiculous and unfair element in a
game for two players.
<dt>King of Dragons
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>When the graphics are lame and the gameplay is boring, adding the

<dt>Kirby's Avalanche
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A.K.A. Puyo-Puyo, A.K.A. Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. Little blobs
fall in pairs and you line them up in groups (not necessarily rows or 
columns) of the same color to clear them. It's Puzzle Fighter without the
detonators. The basic concept doesn't quite work in my opinion but I have
friends that disagree, and you might like it too.
<dt>Kirby's Dream Course
<dd>Game Type: Miniature Golf

so infernally frustrating.

<dt>Lawnmower Man
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

insanely difficult because it has some of the most awesome special effects
ever seen on the SNES.
<dt>Lennus II (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The original Lennus was released here as Paladin's Quest, and this

neither is this.
<dt>Lethal Enforcers
<dd>Game Type: Light Gun Shooting
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>The graphics consist of ugly, ugly digitized sprites but the game is
fairly enjoyable as long as you have a light gun. (It works with crosshairs
but Konami's Justifier is vastly better.)
<dt>Light Fantasy II (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A pleasant mix of Final Fantasy and Shining Force with cute and 
colorful graphics but not much in the way of special effects. A good game 
but you'll have to decide if it's worth figuring out an unfamailiar menu 
system in Japanese.
<dt>Lion King
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Beautiful scenery and awesome character animation. It's really tough,

go through to see it.
<dt>Live-A-Live (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The battle system is a bit difficult to figure out with all the text 
in Japanese, but it's passable. Not much in the way of graphics, either. 
The game really shines when it comes to the the story, though. You choose 
one of several characters, each with a completely different storyline. 
(The caveman's scenario is both hilarious and romantic at once and has no text 
whatsoever.) Not my first choice for import but it's not bad, either.
<dt>Lufia
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Graphically lame but the game is solid and the story is extremely good.
If you're not into RPGs this isn't the place to start but if you are you'll
definitely enjoy it.
<dt>Luna Strike (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: War Sim
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Similar to Military Madness for the TG-16, which is a great game, but 
unless you read Japanese (kanji, not kana) you'll be completely lost in 
all the menus. You may want to settle for Panzer General on the PS.

Tons of weapons, the ability to capture and use enemy ships, and just
plain solid gameplay. Well worth the import for shooter fans.
<dt>Madara 2 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Bland graphics and not much in the way of special effects. Once you 
give the order to attack characters act on their own until you bring up 
the menu again, so most battles can be beaten at the touch of a button 
(which will hardly keep you on your toes). Don't bother.
<dt>Magic Sword
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

primitive.
<dt>Magic Knight Rayearth (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Simplistic but pretty anime-style graphics and an all-female cast. 
What more could an otaku ask for? Well, maybe more special effects, but 
the game shines in every other category and is easy to figure out despite 
all the Japanese text. Consider it for import!
<dt>Magical Drop (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics and audio are a major disappointment if you've played 
MD2 or 3 for the Neo. The colors are hideous and the ghostly voice samples 
will drive you mad after you hear them repeated umpteen times in one 
minute. But the gameplay is 100% intact, and very addictive. This is an 
excellent two player puzzler, but get the Neo or Saturn versions if you can.
<dt>Majin Tensei II (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A sim/RPG vaguely like Shining Force. The graphics are outstanding. 
It's by Atlus so there are small similarities to Revelations - Persona 
on Playstation but this game is far more coherent. The menus are of course 
in Japanese but aren't hard to figure out. Import a used copy if you can.
<dt>Mazinger-Z (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>A platformer somewhat along the lines of X-Men - Mutant Apocalypse but
with hideous character animation and weak moves. Even a domestic release
wouldn't be worth buying. 
<dt>Mech Warrior
<dd>Game Type: First-Person Shooting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Very simplistic; the towns are nothing more than a series of menus and
the game is little more than a showcase for Mode 7. Still, it is well
written and the game has a certain allure. If you're into mech simulators
it's worth a look.
<dt>Mech Warrior 3050
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>A hideously bad attempt to duplicate EA's Strike series. Evading enemy
fire is nigh impossible, the graphics are lame, and the animation is poor.
<dt>Mega Man 7
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Unfortunately Mega Man and Mega Man X are two totally separate entities
in Capcom's eyes, so you can't cling to walls as you can in the X games.
You'll soon forget about that, though, when you see the awesome character 
animation and cool weapons. There's even a hidden two player versus mode.
<dt>Mega Man X
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>This game has playability not seen in the Mega Man series since MM2.

may not be so easy.
<dt>Mega Man X2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

there are even more hidden powerups to be found.
<dt>Mega Man X3
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Finally, you get to play as Zero! Unfortunately you're only allowed
to do so for part of each round, and waiting for him to warp in and out
is so annoying you won't want to do it very often. Aside from that it's
the same old excellent Mega Man game.
<dt>Metal Combat
<dd>Game Type: Light Gun Shooting

<dt>Mickey Mania
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

<dt>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

<dt>Mr. Do
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>

the game is pretty addictive.
<dt>Mortal Kombat
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Most people already have their own opinions on Mortal Kombat, but I

and the gameplay is hampered by bad control.
<dt>Mortal Kombat 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>At least this is somewhat of an improvement. The graphics are more

is probably the best MK game on the SNES.
<dt>Mortal Kombat 3
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>

<dd>Two-on-two bball without having to worry about rules like fouls and

pure action approach may appeal to you, and of course it allows four players.
<dt>Ninja Marantarou Puzzle (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Don't let the ninja name fool you; this is a cute puzzle game like any 
other. It has half the ingredients needed to make it a good game - nice 
graphics and sound and great presentation. Too bad the controls are 
slippery and matches are way too easy to make. An unpleasant mix of Dr. 
Mario and Puyo Puyo.
<dt>Ninja Warriors
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

<dt>Ogre Battle
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>A war sim mixed with RPG elements. You control several platoons of
fantasy creatures and send them from town to town to liberate the
countryside. If a platoon encounters enemy troops a traditional RPG battle
begins. Beautiful, colorful graphics and nice special effects. I swear, if
I hear one more dumbass refer to this as "Orgy Battle"... 
<dt>On the Ball
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Steer a marble through a maze... no it's not Marble Madness 2, you 
rotate the entire maze to do it. Nice sound, appealing graphics, and a 
unique concept. Might not be the game for you but try it if you see it 
because the carts are getting rare.
<dt>Out of this World
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform

<a name="p">

<dt>Pac-Man 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Definitely a unique approach to the genre. Pac-Man has a series of
quests to complete, and instead of guiding him directly you ask him to
move left or right. Depending on his mood he may or may not listen. You
also use a slingshot on different objects to call his attention to them
or knock them away if they're a threat. Nice graphics and great humor.
<dt>Paladin's Quest
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Beautiful (and highly unusual) artwork and an intriguing interface 
where you go through menus without using any buttons by pressing directions 
on the crosspad. Not much in the way of a story, sadly, but otherwise 
great.
<dt>Phantom 2040
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>If Super Metroid wasn't enough for you this may be the next game to

<dt>Pitfall - The Mayan Adventure
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Nice graphics and great character animation but the game is laden
with cheap hits and impossible bosses. The original 2600 version hidden 
within the game is probably its best feature.
<dt>Pipe Dream (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Like many SFami releases by BulletProof Software, this one could've 
almost been released as-is in the U.S., but for some reason never was. 
Enhancements over the NES version include a variety of backgrounds, 
different pre-set obstacle layouts for each stage, and a fun two player 
simultaneous mode. An improvement on a game that was already a blast.
<dt>Pocky and Rocky
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>This game oozes Japanese culture so if you have no tolerance for 
bizarre humor you may want to avoid it. But you'll be missing out on some
of the best graphics, sound, and gameplay ever seen on the SNES. You can
knock incoming bullets back or dive out of the way. Allows two players
simultaneously, too. Look out, Commando.
<dt>Pocky and Rocky 2
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Although the sequel offers even better graphics, more characters, and 
more secrets to find, the two player mode is ruined because half the time
player two is out of the game. Rent before you buy.
<dt>Popful Mail (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>An action RPG somewhat similar to Zelda II. I couldn't be more pleased 
with the animesque graphics but as for the gameplay... the enemies will 
get in a few cheap hits on you, and vice versa. If you've gotta have it, 
Working Designs has translated the Sega CD version, so hunt that down 
instead.
<dt>Pop'n Twinbee (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The only Twinbee game ever released in the U.S. was Stinger for the 
NES. It's too bad because Pop'n Twinbee is one of the best shooters of 
all time. Not a huge powerup system but you can pick up options, drop 
screen bombs, chuck grenades at enemies on the ground, and punch to 
block incoming bullets. Awesome control and great gameplay. Import it!
<dt>Pretty Fighter (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A Street Fighter clone with an all-girl cast. PF's artwork is nice 
(for the most part) but that's about the only redeeming quality. Poor 
animation, an unforgivably short character list, and weak gameplay may 
make even the most die hard otaku think twice.
<dt>Prince of Persia
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Great animation and the swordfighting sequences are cool but the need

<dt>Romancing Sa-Ga (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A Square RPG with graphics highly reminiscient of FF2's (but even more
primitive). The battle system takes the front row/back row aspect of FF2
even further but as a result you waste a lot of time shifting characters
around during battles. It's probably more worth your time to import the
sequels. 
<dt>Romancing Sa-Ga 2 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are a nice middle ground between the styles of
FF2 and Secret of Mana; just visually rewarding enough to hold the
interest of players who can't read Japanese. The battle system has been
reworked slightly to move along faster. Worthwhile if you can get it
cheap.
<dt>Romancing Sa-Ga 3 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Magnificent, colorful graphics and a play style much like the Final Fantasy

Definitely one to import!
<dt>Rudora No Hihou (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>A traditional RPG by Square. Needless to say, it's worth importing. 
The graphics are wonderful, the animation in battles is without compare,

This is as good as a 16-bit RPG gets.
<dt>Run Saber

<dt>Rushing Beat (Super Famicom)

<dd>Another wonderful brawler from Jaleco. (<i>Snicker</i>.) You'd think 
they could have gotten at least <b>one</b> of their character designs right. 
Lame audio, lame graphics, and extremely lame gameplay. It has a four player

<dt>Sailor Moon - Another Story (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>There are no fancy special effects, but the game's nice enough to look at, 
with a colorful pallette and lots of character art. But this was intended as an 
introduction to RPGs for play by school-age girls, and as such it is incredibly 
boring. At least that means there's no kanji, so those with little or no 
experience reading Japanese should be able to muddle through it. But why bother?
You'll have to wander around forever before you encounter a single enemy.
<dt>Sailor Moon R (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>Any of five cute Japanese schoolgirls wanders picturesque downtown

it won't hold anyone's interest for long. At least the game looks pretty.

<dt>Samurai Shodown
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting

<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Not as polished as Zelda and the character animation could be better
but the graphics and music are beautiful and the three player option is
a big bonus.
<dt><a href="seikendensetsu3.html">Seiken Densetsu 3 (Super Famicom)</a>
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>If Square'd had the good sense to translate this it would have been
the sequel to our Secret of Mana. It's more of the same so if you didn't
like Mana you won't like this. There have been a few upgrades, though. You
get your choice of six characters (you pick three), each character can be
any of several classes, and there are tons of spells available. Nice
graphics and beautiful music. May be worth importing.
<dt>7th Saga
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are a bit dull but the special effects are really nice.
It's no Final Fantasy; only two people are allowed in your party at once.
But there are several different storylines to follow. Any RPG fan
will undoubtedly love it.
<dt>Shadowrun
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Vastly different from the Genesis version, and worse graphically, but
the interaction with items and NPCs is much more complex. Check it out,
you'll either love it or hate it.
<dt>Shaq Fu
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 40/100</b>
<dd>Some of the best animation I've ever seen in a fighting game. Too bad 
that's its only good feature. Tiny characters and lame gameplay. Avoid.
<dt>Shien's Revenge
<dd>Game Type: Crosshair Shooting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>This is actually kinda cool for a point-and-shoot game. Take out 
enemies with shurikens and block incoming shots with the cursor. Too short,
though, and way too difficult at the end. Supports the mouse.
<dt>Shinsen Gokuden (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG/Strategy
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>A Shining Force-style RPG starring the Gundam characters. Pretty to look 
at but way too sluggishly paced. The cinematic attack sequences take forever. 
If you don't read Japanese the vast menus will be difficult to figure out.
An okay game but it didn't catch my interest.
<dt>Slayers (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Apparently Banpresto thought fans would want the same level of quality 
in this game that they got in the anime series. In other words, poor. The 
Phantasy Star-like battle scenes are merely okay, and the overhead maps are 
as ugly and lame as Secret of the Stars'. I'm sure the dialogue is every bit 
as funny as the anime's but unless you read Japanese this is not worth your time.
<dt>Skyblazer
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Too bad nobody's heard of this title, it's an awesome game. Colorful
graphics and great gameplay. Ninja Gaiden freaks will love it.
<dt>Sonic Blast Man
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Few moves and lame graphics. No reason to avoid it but no reason to
play it, either.
<dt>Smurfs 2 (European)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Like Jungle Book or the Lion King, and every bit as well animated and 
good looking, but even more sparsely populated with enemies and even less 
fun to play.
<dt>Soul Blazer
<dd>Game Type: Overhead View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Beautiful graphics and enjoyable gameplay. It's more simplistic than
Zelda but from a playability standpoint that's a good thing.
<dt><a href="spacemegaforce.html">Space Megaforce</a>
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>The deepest weapon system in any shooter ever, eye-popping special
effects, colorful graphics, and edge-of-your-seat gameplay. Don't presume
to call yourself a shooter fan if you don't own a copy.
<dt>Star Trek: Next Generation
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Maneuver the members of an away team around various landing sites, 
using their individual skills to solve various puzzles. There are some
flight simulator scenes aboard the Enterprise as well. Trek geeks will
love it but you'll need a hint book to get anywhere.
<dt><a href="starfox.html">StarFox</a>
<dd>Game Type: 3D Chase-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Even the 32-bit systems have yet to produce a better 3D shooter. With
decent polygon graphics, tons of stages, and fantastic gameplay, this
one's a must-have for any SNES owner. 
<dt>Street Fighter II
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>God, I hope you're familiar with this one. A great game but it shows
its age now. Besides, Super SF2 renders this obsolete.
<dt>Street Fighter II Turbo
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The bosses are now playable and the gameplay can be sped up. Whoopee.
Releasing a version with so few upgrades was a mistake.
<dt>Street Fighter Alpha 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>I suppose this is the best translation possible but I gagged on it
after having played the 32-bit versions so much. If you don't have a
Playstation... forget this. Go buy a Playstation.
<dt>Strike Gunner STG
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>The graphics are almost unforgivably primitive for the SNES. STG
partially redeems itself with a whopping fifteen side weapons and a two
player simultaeous mode, though. 
<dt>Super Adventure Island 2
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Cute, colorful graphics and decent gameplay, though it's by no means
addictive. Rent first.
<dt>Super Battletank
<dd>Game Type: 3D Simulation
<dd>Rating: 20/100</b>
<dd>Wander aimlessly among the dunes, spot a tank, blast it, move on.
God, this is boring, and the graphics are hideous. Avoid.
<dt>Super Bomberman
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>In keeping with the Bomberman tradition the one player version is 
awful, but get four people together and the ensuing onscreen chaos will
keep everyone up all night. This is the most simplistic of the SNES
versions, and indeed that may be for the best.
<dt>Super Bomberman 2
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Pretty much the same game with a couple new powerups and new options.
The new multiplayer arenas are a bit too complex for me. Still an awesome,
awesome game.
<dt>Super Bomberman 3 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>What went wrong? The graphics have actually been downgraded. And then
there's the bunnies. Don't get me wrong, they're really cute, but when a
player's riding one he can only perform one type of action, and the two 
hits it takes to kill him is one hit too many. At least five people can
play now, and the music is incredibly good. SB2 is better, though.
<dt>Super Bomberman 5 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The animation is improved but little else has changed since Super 
Bomberman 3. Those damn bunnies are still here. The music is original 
but nowhere near as good. It's a good game but you're better off with SB3
or better yet SB2.
<dt>Super Bombliss(Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Yet another variation on Tetris. The pieces contain bombs which are 
detonated by completing a line containing them. They only affect a certain 
area around them, though, so you need to be careful to position them where 
they won't leave gaping holes in the stack. More cerebral than most puzzle 
games but far less addictive.
<dt><a href="superbusterbros.html">Super Buster Bros.</a>
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Ultra-simplistic arcade action with a few graphic frills. Move back and 
forth across the bottom of the screen, firing harpoons and dodging the 
bouncing bubbles. Highly addictive. This game is just too awesome. 
<dt>Super Dodgeball (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Action
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Fans of the NES version will probably have just as much fun with this 
one, but don't expect exactly the same game. The art style is quite 
different (not necessarily better) and there are a lot more characters to 
choose from. Nice anime cinemas. Not perfect, but not bad.
<dt>Super Empire Strikes Back
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>I'll no doubt piss off a lot of Star Wars fans, but I have to say that
I don't like this series. (The games, not the movies.) The character 
animation is poor, the gameplay is frustrating, and there are way too
many cheap hits. Still, the series has devoted fans. Maybe they see 
something I don't.
<dt>Super Mario RPG
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The rendered graphics look a little rough around the edges, but they're
not too bad overall. A decent game but the spell list could be a lot 
larger.
<dt>Super Mario World
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Colorful graphics, decent gameplay, and dozens of unique stages to
explore. You ought to play this but you probably already have.
<dt>Super Metroid
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Wandering around the labyrinthine halls aimlessly can get a little 
tedious after a while, but the game is spiced up by marvelous graphics,
fantastic music, and a great storyline. One question - what on earth
inspired Nintendo to add that ridiculous voice sample to the intro?
<dt>Super Nazo Puyo 2 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Yet another incarnation of Puyo-Puyo. Sure, it's spiced up by cute 
cinemas, a puzzle mode with an editor, and a pseudo-adventure game, but 
it's still just Puyo-Puyo. There are virtually no differences between 
this and Kirby's Avalanche.
<dt>Super Punch-Out!
<dd>Game Type: 3D Action
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>Goes well beyond the original in terms of graphics. The roster of 
opponents is much larger, too. The gameplay hasn't been changed much but 
then it doesn't need to be.
<dt>Super Return of the Jedi
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>Nice graphics and your choice of several characters to play as, but
the gameplay is still fundamentally flawed with lots of cheap hits.
<dt>Super Star Wars
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>Has all the same problems as the sequels, but some of the stages are 
even more frustrating, and the 3D subgames are really lame.
<dt>Super Trump Collection 2 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Card Games
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A collection of 10 card games, each accompanied by cool music and 
backgrounds. All the text is in Japanese, though, and while it is possible 
to figure out what's going on, it might be easier to just pull out a pack 
of cards.
<dt>Super V.G. (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 60/100</b>
<dd>If you're still willing to waste your time on a 16-bit Street Fighter 
clone and want one with an all-girl cast, choose this over Sailor Moon 
Super S or Pretty Fighter. VG's character designs and gameplay are 
marginally better than its competition's. That still doesn't mean you 
won't get bored with it rapidly. Damn, that intro's cool, though.
<dt>Syonen Ashibe (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>You play as a disgustingly cute baby sea lion that must hunt down all 
the items hidden in various levels and then get to the exit. Extremely easy; 
this game was obviously intended for young kids. Pretty artwork and 
passable gameplay. The music can get annoying, though.

<a name="t">

<dt>Taz-Mania
<dd>Game Type: 3D Racing
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>This is either a unique approach to Tazmania, or a unique approach to
racing games, or both. It's a great game regardless. Chase kiwis down the
highway and jump over or dodge around oncoming traffic. Beautiful graphics 
and awesome gameplay.
<dt>TMNT IV - Turtles in Time
<dd>Game Type: Depth Movement Brawler
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>It doesn't exactly have a huge moves list but the speedy pace and two 
player simultaneous mode help make up for that. Nice graphics, too. There's 
even a one-on-one versus game for when you'd rather beat up on a friend.
<dt>TMNT Tournament Fighters
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>This may well be the best fighter on the system after SF2. Flashy 
special moves, great control, and cool graphics.
<dt>Tetris & Dr. Mario
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>No-frills versions of Tetris and Dr. Mario with colorful graphics 
and great control. Not exactly action-packed like later puzzle games 
but Tetris is still a pleasant diversion.
<dt><a href="tetrisattack.html">Tetris Attack</a>
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 95/100</b>
<dd>Bliss! This game is quickly rising up my all-time greatest games list.
It's definitely not Tetris; you swap pieces around anywhere in the rising 
stacks with a cursor to make rows or columns of the same color. It's very 
fast paced and in two player mode it's quite possibly the most addictive
game I've ever played. Buy this game <b>now</b>!
<dt>Tetris Battle Gaiden (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>This game was a major influence on TetriNet. The game plays like 
regular Tetris but some pieces contain crystals. If you clear a line 
containing a crystal you gain magic points, which allow you to do attacks 
on your opponent. Cute graphics and lots of characters to play as.
<dt>Tekkaman Blade (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Side-View Shooter/2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>You're at the helm of a traditional Japanese giant mech. The shooter 
portions are pretty enjoyable despite the poor powerup system, but the 
2D fighting sequences with the bosses are awful (no better than Heavy 
Nova). The graphics could be better, too.
<dt><a href=tenchimuyorpg.html">Tenchi Muyo RPG (Super Famicom)</a>
<dd>Game Type: Isometric-View RPG
<dd>Rating: 85/100</b>
<dd>Even with its limited number of enemy types this game is straining at 
the limits of its 16MBit cart, thanks to lots of voice samples (by the 
original voice actors) and character art. The animation could be better 
but the graphics are otherwise excellent. Perfectly balanced Shining 
Force-style gameplay. Easy to figure out even with no knowledge of 
Japanese. A little too short but fans of the series should strongly 
consider importing it anyway.
<dt>Tenchi Sozo (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>It's published by Enix, and it's obviously a kindred spirit to SoulBlazer 
and Illusion of Gaia. The gameplay has been improved substantially since 
Gaia; your character has quite a few special abilities. The artwork and 
special effects are great. Well worth a look for any adventure game 
afficionado. Released as Terranigma in Europe.
<dt>Terranigma (PAL SNES)
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The English release of Tenchi Sozo only appeared in Europe. Some puzzles 
that rely heavily on clues are much more easily solved with the text in 
English, but you're not missing out on much of a story if you play the 
game in Japanese. Besides, the cart has strong NTSC protection, meaning 
you'll need a PAL SNES or a converted U.S. model to play it. It's a good 
game but it's not really worth that much trouble. (European readers, get it!)
<dt>Tetris Battle Gaiden (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Puzzle
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Tetris, pure and simple - almost. The only real difference from 
straight Tetris is that some pieces contain crystals which you can use to 
attack your opponent. Not the most intense puzzle game out there but one 
of the most enjoyable.
<dt>Thunder Spirits
<dd>Game Type: Side-View Shooter
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A port of the Genesis' Thunder Force III. Nice graphics and a good 
powerup system, though I'm not crazy about the gameplay.
<dt>Tin-Star
<dd>Game Type: Light Gun Shooter
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Colorful, cartoony, mildly amusing. It offers decent action and lots
of challenge, too. Supports the Super Scope, mouse, and control pad.
Consider this long before you consider Lethal Enforcers.
<dt>Tiny Toons - Buster Busts Loose 
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Colorful and speedy. Too bad the attacks are so strange or I might 
have rated it even higher.
<dt>Tiny Toons - Wacky Sports Challenge
<dd>Game Type: 2D Action
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A collection of subgames that have little to do with any real sport.
Some of the events are more enjoyable than others. Still, if you like 
Track and Field you may go for this.
<dt>Total Carnage
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>Some of the worst graphics I have ever seen on the SNES or any other
system. The gameplay is okay but it would have to be a lot better to save
this crap.
<dt>Traverse (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: RPG
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A decent RPG, but it may not be too enjoyable for those who can't read 
Japanese due to its heavy emphasis on relationships between the characters. 
(There are many menu choices to be made during conversations.) The special 
effects don't stand up to Chrono Trigger's too well but the graphics are 
nice.
<dt>Treasure Hunter G (Super Famicom)  
<dd>Game Type: RPG 
<dd>Rating: 90/100 
<dd>Developed by Sting (no, not that Sting) and published by Square. The
battle system is vaguely similar to Shining Force's, but fights move along
much, much faster. Beautiful backgrounds, awesome special effects,
wonderful music. As good as or better than Chrono Trigger. Square should
definitely translate this for the U.S. but there's no way they will with
the SNES on its deathbed.
<dt>Twinbee 2 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Not exactly what I expected since Twinbee games are usually shooters. 
Still, it's an excellent platformer, a cross between Rocket Knight and 
Sonic the Hedgehog (very speedy). Nice art, too, although it's a bit heavy 
on the pastels.
<dt>The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>If you only count graphics and gameplay this game could take on Zelda.
There's even a secret two player mode. It's almost a tragedy this game is 
so unbelievably short.

<a name="u">

<dt>Umihara Kawase (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>If you're really, really desperate for something similar to Bionic 
Commando, this might be worth importing. Be warned, though, that this is 
much slower-paced, the grappling hook is much harder to get the hang of 
(no pun intended), the graphics and sound are only average, and the 
heroine wears a pink backpack.
<dt>Ushio and Tora (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>Based directly on the OVA series. You can play as either Ushio or his 
demon pal Tora. Even if you're a fan (and you shouldn't be, the series is 
lame) you needn't bother. Poorly designed control, floaty jumps, cheap 
hits galore, and weak graphics.

<dt>Warlock
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 50/100</b>
<dd>Nice graphics and awesome animation but defending yourself is 
practically impossible. Awful gameplay.
<dt>Wild Guns
<dd>Game Type: Crosshair Shooting
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>A clone of Nam 1975 featuring, strangely enough, cowboys against mechs.
The action is decent and it allows two players at once. Original enough to 
be worth a rental at least.

<a name="x">

<dt>X-Kaliber 2097
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The music is pretty cool; too bad it repeats every couple stages.
Although there's a cheap hit or two the gameplay is pretty good overall, 
and the graphics are nice.
<dt>X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>Not the most addictive gameplay on earth but with five beautifully 
animated characters, each with their own Street Fighter-style special
moves, this game is worth renting anyway. (Psylocke rocks!)
<dt>Xardion
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 30/100</b>
<dd>Steer a mech through a sluggish platform game. Utterly boring, don't 
even bother renting.

<a name="y">

<dt>Yadamon Wonderland Dreams (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Mystery
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A graphic/text adventure with lots of mini-games designed for young 
kids. A good piece of software, but unless you're trying to teach your 
five-year-old Japanese, I don't see why anyone outside of Japan would 
want it. 
<dt>Yoshi's Island
<dd>Game Type: 2D Platform
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>My only gripe with this game is the silly timer, which basically 
renders you impervious to all but pits. Aside from that the gameplay is
good. Colorful graphics and incredible special effects.
<dt>YuYu Hakusho 2 (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: 2D Fighting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>A passable Street Fighter clone. The moves and characters are fairly 
cool but I wish the character animation was a bit better.
<dt>YuYu Hakusho Final (Super Famicom)
<dd>Game Type: Cinematic Fighting
<dd>Rating: 70/100</b>
<dd>The only game in this category I have ever played (though perhaps 
that's not such a bad thing). You have no direct control over your 
character; moves are executed by charging up a meter, then shown in cool 
anime-style cinemas. Visually stunning and actually enjoyable for a 
while at least, but the game does wear thin eventually.

<a name="z">

<dt>Zelda - A Link to the Past
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Adventure
<dd>Rating: 90/100</b>
<dd>By no means as addictive as the first Zelda, but it's still a blast 
the first time through thanks to the beautiful graphics and intriguing
puzzles. Why's the second world have to be so dreary, though?
<dt>Zombies Ate My Neighbors
<dd>Game Type: Overhead-View Action
<dd>Rating: 80/100</b>
<dd>The graphics and animation are lame but the gameplay is decent, two
can play simultaneously, and there are dozens of huge levels to work
through. Once you get into the game it will keep you busy for quite a 
while.
