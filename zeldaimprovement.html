<h4>An Overworld Editor for The Legend of Zelda</h4>

<p>When I was young and gullible, I was more than willing to attempt 
all the fake methods my friends described to me for getting the raft 
to take off from the eastern coast of Hyrule. I loved The Legend of 
Zelda so much that I was constantly longing for new lands to explore. 

<p>Only now, years later, do I actually have them. _demo_, a member 
of the Mario Improvement team, has joined forces with EFX to produce 
Zelda Improvement, a utility that lets users edit the overworld data 
for a Zelda ROM. Now any emulator user can journey through a 
virtually limitless number of amateur-designed worlds.

<p>At the time of this writing, ZI is only at version 0.1, and hence 
is still a little buggy. It may always be a little difficult to 
use, due to the awkward method Zelda uses to store the overworld 
map. Unlike many hacking utilities, though, ZI can atually be figured 
out with the help of the only semi-cryptic documentation. And with 
patience, even novice users can create worlds that rival Nintendo's 
original.

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<img src="zeldaimprovement2.jpg" align=right>

<p>As anyone who's played Zelda knows, the overworld consists of 
a grid of individual screens, each 8 rows by 16 columns. In the Zelda 
ROM, each screen is stored as a set of 16 bytes. (Found in offset 
h15429-h15BB4, to be specific.) The value from 0-255 in each byte 
represents one of 256 different preset columns.

<p>The hex value 0F, for example, represents a line of bushes at the 
top and bottom of the screen, with open ground in the center. 0E 
represents a solid line of bushes. So if you were to replace part of 
a screen's data with 0F-0F-0F-0F-0E, for example, you would have 
a small path lined by bushes, leading up to a dead end. There are 
similar preset columns for lakes, cliffs, cave entrances, even the 
waterfall. Zelda's entire overworld is constructed from these 
simplistic building blocks, and you can use these blocks to create 
your own worlds.

<p>With Zelda Improvement, though, you don't need to worry about hex 
offsets or what value represents a rock wall. The interface is 
entirely graphical. Users navigate a map of the overworld, find a 
screen they want to edit, click on a column, and then flip through 
all the possible replacements for that column onscreen. With a single 
keystroke, changes are saved directly to the ROM, ready for playing. 
It's still a tedious process in this early version, but ZI is a lot 
easier than using a hex editor.

<h2>Designers' Tips</h2>

<p>Of course, your level designs need to be compatible with Zelda's 
multitude of prgramming quirks. Here are a few tips to ensure players 
can actually beat the game you've designed:

<ul>
<li>Entrances must remain intact. If you move a cave entrance to 
another location on the same screen, users can still get in, but 
when they exit the cave they will appear where the original entrance 
was. If you've placed a rock wall there, they'll be stuck.
<li>Watch out for preset columns with special features. There 
are two columns with a rock in the center of the screen, and they 
may look exactly alike, but one of them will allow you to push 
the rock and reveal an entrance, and the other will not. There 
are also preset columns with bombable rocks and other features.
<li>The data for a few screens is duplicated several places in the 
overworld. If you edit the screen with the faery's spring, for 
example, those edits will be duplicated in three other places 
(including the entrance to Level 7, which may become inaccessible).
<li>Keep users walled in. If you leave an opening along the edge of 
the map and a player walks through it, the game won't crash, but 
there will be a weird fadeout and Link will be warped to the center 
of the screen, possibly getting stuck in the process. The same goes 
for placing caves on screens where there weren't caves originally.
<li>Make sure dungeons are accessible! Players not only need to be 
able to reach dungeons to clear the game, they have to be able to 
get to them in the right order. If they can't get the ladder from 
Level 4, for example, they won't be able to clear Level 6. (Of 
course designing with both Quests 1 and 2 in mind will be 
difficult.)
<li>Leave enemies room to breathe. Actually the game is pretty
"smart" in this respect; Zolas will only appear where there's water
(and only on screens where they're programmed to), Molblins emerging 
from the edge of the screen will only appear on an open path, and 
Leevers look for open ground before emerging. If you make a fancy 
walled-in design with bushes, though, and an Oktorok appears in the 
center of the screen, it'll be trapped.
<li>The game tracks whether the player entered a cave by walking 
down a north-facing entrance or by entering a west-facing set of 
steps. When the player leaves the cave, they will either reappear 
suddenly, or emerge slowly, making the walking-up-steps sound.
If the preset entrance is in the middle of flat ground and the 
the user entered a north-facing cave, they will walk up through 
the ground, which looks wierd.
</ul>

<h2>User-Designed Worlds</h2>

The text has also been updated to reflect the new world. This 
version is much more challenging than the original.</td>

<p>Let's see what <b>you</b> can do! If you've done an 
edit for Zelda, <a href="mailto:jay@mcgavren.com">E-mail me</a>, 
and we'll make arrangements to get it posted here. Be warned, 
though, that all edits will be rated, and if it's not a quality 
job I can be brutal. <i>Grin</i>.

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="files/zi01.zip">Zelda Improvement V0.1</a>.
<li>Legend of Zelda ROM, U.S. V1.0 (No reminder to hold Reset at Save 
screen.) <b>NOTE:</b> All ROM requests will be ignored.
<li>An emulator such as <a href="nestc043.zip">Nesticle</a>, for 
bugtesting.
<li><a href="snestl12.zip">SNESTOOL</a> to create an IPS patch (since 
distributing even an edited ROM would violate copyright law).
</ul>
