<h2>Review</h2>

<img src="tetrisattack.jpg" align=right>

<p><b>Game Type: Puzzle</b>
<br>Definitely <b>not</b> a Tetris game. Sure, if the screen fills you
lose, but that's where the similarity ends. You move a cursor that 
highlights two blocks at a time freely around the screen. Hit the button 
to make the two highlighted blocks swap places. Line up three of the same
color vertically or horizontally to make them disappear. Several play
modes are available for one or two players.

<p><b>Gameplay: 95/100</b>
<br>Budding game developers will be studying this game for years to come.
It is simply as close to perfection as gameplay design gets. The basic 
concept alone is great. It's one of the few puzzle games that lets you 
manipulate blocks that are already on the screen. Once a piece is placed
you're not stuck with it; you can go back and correct your mistakes.
But there are other puzzle games with a great basic concept 
collecting dust on peoples' shelves. That's why the designers went on 
to add all the little nuances that make a truly great game.
<br>The whole game is designed to let players build really long chain 
reactions to drop garbage blocks on your opponent. You can line up the 
second match in a chain even while the first is being cleared from the 
screen. Garbage blocks can form chains when they turn into normal blocks. 
You can also hit your opponent by getting two matches with one swap. A 
skilled player can fill his opponent's screen in a matter of seconds.
The forgiving chain system allows for incredible stunts, which is the
main reason this game is so addictive.

<p><b>Graphics: 80/100</b>
<br>There are no eye-popping special effects (it's a puzzle game, fer
cryin' out loud!) but the colorful look is great if you don't mind the 
cutesy atmosphere. Hey, it'll get your girlfriend to play. You choose 
any of eight characters (twelve with a code), each with their own 
backgrounds. (I was peeved to learn that Yoshi and his goons were only 
used for the American version, and that the Japanese one had anime 
chicks.)

<p><b>Sound: 80/100</b>
<br>Each character has his own music and sound effects. Some tunes are 
great, others poor. Again, not bad if you don't mind cute.

<p><b>Overall: 95/100</b>
<br><b>Bow and worship this game.</b> If it weren't for the cute look it 
would probably be my favorite game of all time. (In fact it might be 
anyway, but I need another year of playing it to make a big decision like that.)
In a perfect world it would be available on every platform, but for now
it's exclusive to SNES and Gameboy. I don't think I've ever played 
anything this addictive. Rent this game and have some friends 
over and I guarantee each of you will go out an purchase his own copy 
the next day. I cannot recommend strongly enough that you check this 
game out!
